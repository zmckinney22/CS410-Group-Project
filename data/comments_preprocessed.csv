1o77mip,njorcz7,I'll keep an eye on the project as there seem to be quite a few hills that the pre-commit maintainer is willing to die on. My most recent examples are the lack of support for JSON with comments which is popular despite what anyone thinks about it and the arbitrary performance demands for attempts to implement support for auto completion. Found workarounds for both but it annoyed me. To be clear I respect his decision and it's his judgement as the maintainer. I'm thankful that I get to use the tool for free.

1o77mip,njlrkgf,"well, no, its not the hooks themselves that are slow. Its python that is slow, and which has a very large overhead. You can take pre-commit and prek for a spin and compare, or you can take uv and and compare it with pip, poetry or PDM all doing IO bound operations, or if you wish you can take numpy C and try to implement it in python to see the difference. Python is one of the slowest languages around. This is a known limitation of the language, which is otherwise a beautiful piece of delight.

1o77mip,njm7bs0,"Why does everything need to be rewritten in rust? I don't get it either. I thought the whole point of Rust was memory safety without garbage collection. That means if you're working in a domain where you can't afford the overhead of garbage collection e.g. OS kernels or hard real-time systems, Rust enables memory safety. Previously these domains were stuck using unsafe languages, mainly C or C. But if you can afford to use a garbage collector, why not do so? Why introduce the complexity of Rust's borrow checker into your code, instead of using a GC language that handles all that complexity for you?",4,1760533998.0

1o77mip,njloz14,"It can be useful to enforce code quality for example, running a formatter like Ruff will prevent commits that dont meet certain guidelines. More commonly though, it just depends on your projects use case. Publishing a lot of bash scripts? Run a hook that prevents pushing a shebang file that isnt executable. Working with a lot of secure secrets in file form? Run a hook ensuring no credentials are included in a commit. People are hit or miss on this, but I love running pytest as a pre-push hook. We test in CI, but it can take a bit of time and I want to be sure I didnt forget anything before the job runs.

The latter is what youre asking for, but this means, instead of getting your import errors as soon as you try to run the file finding your problem immediately, you only get them if a specific line of code runs - this is a nightmare, thats why its good practice not to put imports inside functions unless you have to.",14,1760778190.0
1o9gyxa,nk3dkie,"It makes sense to me when I think that importing a i.e 'import numpy' imports the init.py in a numpy directory in sys.path. This module controls it's own namespace. There are other modules along side it numpy.ma, numpy.typing but they are not in the numpy namespace unless the numpyinit.py module actually includes them. However, when you import modules i.e import numpy.ma it loads them from the module file i.e. numpyma.py, not from the numpy packagemodule that was already loaded. import is directory based, with init.py providing modules for packages. Your idea to just import it implicitly conflates these two notions, and asks that an import shove a module into a package that didn't include it. I think this would be more confusing than the existing state of affairs. How would conflicts be resolved? Would the one defined by the package module take precedence, or the one defined by a module with the same name? I hope this helps clarify what is actually happening when you 'import numpy.typing' load typing.py vs 'import numpy numpy.typing' use typing variable in numpy package module.",8,1760762787.0

There are modules where you import a.b but you can't just import a - it doesn't exist on its own, nor does it know about all the possible packages a.c, a.d, ... that could exist. I think the key is in realizing that when a module imports a submodule, it just becomes another object. It's up to the writers whether to import all their submodules like that or not.

1o9gyxa,nk4t6kf,"This reminds me unrelated hurdles one must do to write a library that doesn't export its own imports from math import cos as cos etc, as there's no other way to mark a visibility hint except in the name itself. I so wish something could be done with that in the future! In contrast, Lua has quite a sane approach each file is like a body of an argumentless function, and it can define variables local to it as well as globals, and it doesn't export locals by default. You have to return explicitly what you wish to be returned by a corresponding require.... It can even be a number or a string though returning a table analogous to Python dict is what's expected its fields are what the importer would use. What you didn't set up explicitly doesn't get out. Great nitpicks about Lua here is 1 local is marked and global is unmarked, which is very error-prone, compared to Python, because accidentally created globals will indeed leak everywhere and 2 Lua doesn't allow partial imports, again compared to Python. As Python has class syntax, in principle a Python-like language would would be able to return a class instance if there'd be any faculty of explicitly returning stuff from a module. If Python had object literals that define a single instance of an unnamed class, using a body just like class does but init or new should take no extra arguments, that'd be even more good-looking. Lua comes our alright from this by having a special-cased syntax for string keys in tables and by treating t.name the same as t'name', so defining such a table of exports is clean code with no quotes and brackets and it also allows simultaneously defining a function and assigning it to a key, which again cleans things up in this export scenario.",3,1760791800.0

In this approach, Zuban could import and cache mypy's inferred type surfaces for only the affected symbols or modules, then resume its own analysis using that data. This would preserve Zuban's performance and determinism for the vast majority of code while transparently supporting plugin-based ecosystems without requiring a separate dual-run setup.

It's right next to the 'Run' program button. Whenever your code executes and hits that line you placed the breakpoint, the code freezes. At that point, you can see the value of every variable. You can even call methods on the variables in their current state. You can change the value of a variable in the middle of the run. You can step down one more line, and just 'walk through' and see how the values of variables change. You can 'step into' methods.

1o8k30b,njxub7f,"The difference isnt necessarily technicalits often a matter of business needs and career trajectory. If you learn older technologies like C.NET or Java, youre likely to find yourself maintaining legacy systems in large, established companiesespecially in industries like banking or fintech. These companies adopted these technologies when they were cutting-edge, and because they prioritize stability and long-term support, theyre unlikely to change their tech stack anytime soon. Another consideration with languages like Java and C is that the field tends to be populated with many seasoned professionals and gurus. While you can learn a lot from these experts and gain valuable mentorship, it can also be harder to stand out and advance to higher roles, such as tech lead or principal engineer. The bar is often higher because these roles are filled by very experienced individuals with deep knowledge of the stack. On the other hand, newer languages like Python, JavaScript, and Go are popular in the startup world. Theyre often chosen because they allow for rapid development and quick iterationsperfect for businesses that need to ship products fast. The trade-off is that these languages tend to favor speed and simplicity over the strict structure and boilerplate youd find in more traditional languages, making them a great fit for agile, fast-moving teams. So, choosing between these languages is often less about technical superiority and more about the type of environment you want to work inwhether you prefer maintaining stable, enterprise-grade systems or building the next big thing in a fast-paced startup.",1,1760690016.0
1o8k30b,njy7k66,"For the backend, I recommend thinking in terms of Docker or even K8s instead of a language. That way you get containerisation by definition, and can deploy the best service for the job, no matter what language it's written in. Occasionally some battle tested application like Keycloak that I need crops up written in Java. There are other services written in Lua Kong Gateway and even Haskell PostgREST. So I would've deployed .NET already in a container if it was practicable in Docker, or if there was any support from the open source community to build things in .NET that people actually need on their Backends. And I actually quite like C and don't mind Visual Studio. F is enticing and has very favourable reviews. Microsoft's online documentation is generally thorough, and sometimes can be very good. But firstly, even now that .NET is multiplatform and there's Mono too, Microsoft still has a bad habit of inventing new names and terminology for the same concepts as everyone else, just for the sake of it. Just to differentiate themselves in the market place. I can't be bothered devoting an entire compartment in my brain to unpicking such a tedious clusterphuq, simply to learn new names for stuff I already know, because some Microsoft exec with an MBA didn't want to get sued by Oracle, or wanted to lock devs in to .NET and make it artificially harder to learn Java. Secondly, I hope I'm wrong, and maybe this goes for Java too and don't get me started on nodemodules but whenever I install a .NET application, it just feels extremely bloated, needing to download an update for the latest framework. Or even the entire latest version of the framework, just to keep the damned thing happy, to do a simple task a few MB of C, 5MB of Rust, or 10MB of Go including the whole FROM Scratch image could do in a Docker container.

Theres also widespread misunderstanding just because its involved with Microsoft. A lot of people believe .net is entirely closed-source, or that its windows exclusive, or that you have to pay Microsoft to use it. And yes, there is a reddit bias, probably that bleeds over from the political bias on here. Theres also the experience bias, lots of people try python for something because its a common go-to prototype language. Then theres the front-end people who learn javascript first, and so instead of learning something new for their backend, they just look for the best thing they can do in javascript. A real shame, since js is generally a clusterfuck of a language. As for Java, I maintain that in basically all general purpose situations, you can findreplace Java with C and the outcome is the same. Anyone heavily pro-Java and anti-C at the same time is almost always for political reasons and very little to do with either language.

Synergy between PHP virtual hosting control panels and popular web apps like Wordpress brought us PHP everything everywhere before cloud options. The more elegant tool for some startups was in Ruby or Python. All of those were easy on the hosting company and startups budgets because of open source licensing.

Everytime it moves, a new position is added to one end of the queue that is the head and the last position in the queue is removed from the queue that is the end of the tail. Except when eating something, the tail is not removed. So you don't change the position of the head, you add a new head in front of the snake, depending on the direction it is moving. Use an actual Queue data structure if you can - that makes everything easier.

1o7ueik,njqsip7,"Strictly speaking, you don't need both for-loops and while-loops. In fact, when I was young and the only programming language I knew was BASIC, I realized that you didn't even need FOR-loops you could accomplish the same thing with just IF-statements and GOTOs. So why did BASIC use FOR loops at all? Because sometimes you want a loop that iterates using a counter variable, and writing a FOR-loop makes it so much easier to write and read than using only IFs and GOTOs. Okay, so why do some languages also use while-loops in addition to for-loops? Because sometimes the logic you want to implement is clearer as a for-loop with a counter andor current element, and sometimes the logic is clearer as a loop that continues while a condition remains true. Some programming languages allow the use of an until-loop, a loop that keeps running until a condition is met. An until-loop is functionally equivalent to a while-not-loop, so why is there a need for an until-loop? Well, it's not that there's a specific need for it, it's that sometimes the logic is clearer when you realize that a body of code needs to be repeated over and over until a specific condition is met -- or that the body needs to repeatedly execute with the goal of causing that condition to be true.",3,1760588866.0

Those things compile down to labels and goto's but make code more readable. What's interesting is how programmers don't realise that if statements have the same problem - of being too low level. Often things like switch or match or using polymophism function pointer tables often do a far better job at explaining decisions than using dozens of if statements. This is rarely spoken about. I've seen things like if warehouse.location America printDocumentpaperSize USLetter else printDocumentpaperSize A4 only for someone to later refactor the printDocument function without considering the higher level callers and then go on to do if paperSize A4 ....

1o7ueik,njrn36t,"A while-loop can do exactly what a for-loop can do. They both exist as to express what the intended purpose is. For example, consider this int x setsomevalue while x 25 dosomething x This is easy to understand. You set X to some value. As long as that value is under 25, you keep doing something. If x starts out at 25 or higher, you do nothing. In this case, using the while-loop, you state that you are going to do something, while x is not yet 25, and you don't know how many iterations that will be. Compare it to this int x setsomevalue for x x 25 x dosomething With the for-loop, you state that you going to do a set number of dosomething calls, but because the loop starts with x, this set number of calls is actually variable. You are using a loop designed to express a set number of calls to do a variable number of calls. This is less clear than the while loop. You normally use a for-loop like this for int i 0 i 25 i ... In this case you know you are going to loop exactly 25 times. You will know, without having to know anything else about the code, that the loop will start at 0 and end at 24, and that each iteration is available in i. In the previous for-loop example, you wouldn't have known the starting point without looking at the output of setsomevalue, and to know THAT, you may have to look at other code as well. For looping over a collection without having to specifically count, many languages have a version of a foreach-loop foreach int x in list dosomethingx You can do this with a for-loop or a while-loop, but the foreach-loop clearly expresses that you are not interested in the number of iterations, nor the length of the collection 'list' you just want to dosomething with each value in the list. Some languages also have an infinite loop, if you want to express that something needs to loop forever, except if something special happens loop int x getvalue if x -1 break ... You could express it with a while-loop, or a for-loop, or even an until-loop, but the loop forever, except ... is better expressed with the infinite loop-loop.

If you are not good at solving problems, if you are not good at mathematics which involves solving problems, or if you are not good with logic which also involves solving problems, you just can't code. At least, that's my experience. Youtubers teach you the syntax. That's the easy part. This is by far the worst moment of my life.

It does also sound like there's an increasing amount of ITdev consulting involving cleaning up some vibe coded crap, so I can only hope I'm not headed for a similar situation. If you are not good at solving problems, Yeah, software engineering, like pretty much any engineering afaik, is a lot about knowing how to break down problems into smaller pieces until you get to a level you know how to solve, and then synthesising one solution from all the mini-solutions to the mini-problems. More experienced engineers can work on bigger problems at a time, less experienced engineers need to break everything down to very small problems. This is by far the worst moment of my life. All my skills soft skills, language skills, translation, writing, coaching, interviewing people, and so on are totally useless. Sorry for the vent, but this situation is really stressing me out. Yeah, it sounds like a shit situation. Personally I'd like it if you could get a job writing and managing technical documentation. Coders very frequently suck at it, likely not because of any innate problem, but just out of a lack of understanding that technical writing and library management are skills of their own. IMO more organisations should have dedicated writers and archivistslibrarians to help them manage the software and complexity they build. It's a constant complaint from devs and managers as soon as an org gets somewhat large, that they don't have good documentation and that it's too hard to discover, etc, etc. Because maintaining those things is actually skilled work, but for some reason they don't hire skilled workers to perform it, we expect employees with entirely different skills to just magically be good at that as well. And just like in so many other fields, plenty are hoping LLMs will be the silver bullet for that too. I'm not going to hold my breath for an LLM to generate and manage good documentation for an organization it can only model statistically, rather than talk to and understand. Again, I can only hope you find some meaningful work where you can actually use your skills, because they are valuable, and hopefully will be seen as that again after society's infatuation with these bullshit generators is over.",1,1760443529.0

Learning how to evolve the architecture because whatever design you have will inevitably change. 4 Communicating with your colleagues and clients about the designs and software architecture and everything else. This is probably the most important skill. I was a poor communicator during my studies and I had to learn on the job. It supercharges everything you do when you work in a team and across teams. Suddenly you can get other people to do things they dont want to do too without being a dick! Presentation skills are important. 5 Learning and applying good software practices.

The client was so happy with me, I was hired on the spot. The team I'm working with doesn't bother using a single cell in their brain to develop something. Let alone development, they aren't even properly capturing the client requirements. Everything is shot into Copilot since we can't access ChatGPT. EVERY. SINGLE. THING.

Heck, save for DQL, I need to refer to Google for the syntax of everything SQL insertion, triggers, indexes, etc. But asking what type of JOIN is the default JOIN.... And it's not just this, but there were sooo many instances before and after this that just made me cynical. I believe, its a matter of zeal to upskill yourself that differentiates professionals.

1o6w160,njmhp0z,"Decades ago, I got a job but didn't take it with a flying school I was a flight instructor which focused on training missionary pilots. A fairly good chunk of their requirements were religious. I am about as religious as a fart in an elevator. They asked how I had found god whereupon I gave them a 10 page essay on meeting some rando, but famous, evangelical minister in a diner, and I sat with him and he led me to god's grace, I then travelled with that minister for a month before he said that it was time for me to spread the word with ministries in my area. And I did have proof of that. I then had a few friends hand write me glowing praise as tent revival style ministers who said that my quiet enthusiasm was more effective than their louder style. I had asked a theologian about biblical quotes which could be interpreted as flying bringing you closer to god, and how ministering to primitives is a good thing. These people were doing that whole deepest Africa sort of thing. I am certain they called the day they got my application, and basically had two questions. One was about spreading the word in Africa, which is why I instantly had those quotes ready. And the other was if I were gay. Will your wife be joining you? I was 20, and of course, I was getting married next fall, and then she would join me I had a job offer informally on the phone, and by mail a week later. They had all kinds of rules about single men including the instructors being back in the dorm by such and such a time, no drinking, and others you would expect. The pay was good, piloting jobs were thin on the ground, and I still just changed careers instead. ----------------------------- Note People have mentioned christians paying poorly. This might have been the best paying, by far, junior instructor's job I ever saw. Including a dorm was really kind of cool for someone starting out in this industry. It is not uncommon for junior instructors to have a second job which reliably pays the bills, and to live in hovels with 4 other pilots. There was that one catch, but if that was your bag, then all might have been good. Also, there is a 100 chance I would have spent my idle time corrupting their youth.",1,1760537473.0

How on Earth did you not come up with the idea of using a vanilla Vue.jsReact for simple projects? Nobody forces you to use SSR frameworks, nobody forces you to install redux and state management libraries, and nobody stops you from using a separated backend server for API routes. Vue and React already have an excellent state management. Most of the time you don't need any additional state management libraries. Caching is easily done by using the library. bloated apps with poor performance when a simpler solution would work better. We are living in 2025, even the cheapest phones that use Firefox can handle a significant amount of JS code. The poor performance that you are referring to, I guess, is not really the framework issue. AFAIK poor performance on most websites is caused by layout thrashing, CSS animationstransitions that require DOM re-calculations, or just a dozen of event listeners in the main thread without any kind of debouncingthrottling. This list can go further, but the key idea here is that JS frameworks affect website's performance way less than your own code. It's up to you whether to care or not about DOM limitations.

Having worked with these assistants however, I am really doubtful of these claims that frontend devs are in danger, and in aggregate I say this because despite the many claims of vibe coding replacing everyone, we have not seen an explosion of new products everywhere made by people with no or little knowledge or experience. That's perhaps the biggest sign of BS from these modern claims. We should be seeing output many times X and we're simply not.",11,1760538159.0

Common people, their connections and black market transactions were what made supply and demand match. There is a queue in front of a shop? This means you can buy something useful there. I mean useful to somebody, not necessarily to you. Even if you have no daughters and you don't smoke, it's still smart to buy girl's clothes and the maximum allowed amount of Cuban cigars, because you can swap them with a relative or a coworker for something you actually want or need. You're going on a business trip to a closed town a town where you can't go without a permit because it has a strategic factory? You should remember or write down sizes of everyone in your family, all of your friends, coworkers and their families maybe you'll find some decent clothes or shoes in their size. If you see something useful as a gift, you obviously buy it one of your coworkers will definitely be invited to a wedding soon and you can sell them this gift. You can't predict what you'll find in a shop. Today neighbourhoods with the biggest increase in party members per capita get Cuban cigars. Tomorrow neighbourhoods with the worst sales of cigars in the past month get girls' clothes. Once you know what you can buy today, you immediately join the queue, you don't waste time calling someone. It is entirely possible that you reacted to fake news or the shop is out of stock when it's your turn bad for you, you wasted 3 hours of your life. However, if you're friends with someone working in a shop, you might get a call. If you're a close friend of the shop director or they owe you a favour, they might keep you something under the counter. And if you're high up in the party, you suddenly have access to shops where you can actually buy what you need.",181,1760401214.0

As a 12-year-old American suburban kid, it was quite an eye opening experience. It was like Id stepped into a Time Machine and went back 25 years - old cars, old clothes, old everything. No commercial brands of anything, everything was generic and state produced. Our dad told us to dress down so we wouldnt stand out in our American clothes. Military men with big guns stood on street corners and in front of important buildings. We were also told to be careful how we talked and not say anything negative about what we saw or heard while we were there, and not compare it to America in any way. That said, people were super friendly and supportive of each other, probably because they often had to be. My father had grown up as a street urchin in the city, had fled the country in his late teens, and actually had to sneak in and back out while my brother and I went through normal customs. He feared being found out, arrested and jailed, but wanted us to see his country and meet our Hungarian grandparents.

1o5n2u1,njbvuda,"Not Soviet, but my mother-in-law grew up in communist China under Chairman Mao and all that. Being the right level of loyal was hard, even if you truly believed in it all and many people honestly did due to the rampant brainwashing. If you did everything right, you'd be asked to join the local branch of the party. On the other hand, if you made too many mistakes, that had its own problems. You might get transferred somewhere crappy to be someone else's problem, or if you were deemed unfit for normal work you might even be assigned some back-breaking drudgery instead. My mother-in-law was a doctor, so even making small mistakes here and there wasn't an option she was willing to risk. She kept her head down, did her job, didn't make waves, and still got asked to join the local party several times. The standard way to refuse was Oh, I'm not good enough, but even that could only be used so many times. Outright refusal to join the party was seen as being a traitor, which could be deadly. Being in the party was good for the top person and precarious for everyone else. Some people wanted to do it because you got to enjoy a lot of luxeries, but most people just wanted to live their lives without possibly being purged on the whim of the leader. She said one way to get out of it was bribes, although that had its own risks, of course. Another was to have a baby--despite officially being about gender equality, it was an open secret that the reality was far from equal, and mothers were seen as unreliable party members because of their tendency to put their kids first, especially if the kid happens to still be a baby. She told amazing stories about growing up in that time. Some of it was great, like how relatively safe it was. Much of it was terrible, like the way people disappeared for political reasons and you'd never know what happened to them, or the horrific famines that happened because of the rejection of agricultural science Lysenkoism. But overall, her feeling was that it just got in the way. Most people just want to do their jobs, spend time with their families, and maybe have a hobby or two, but communism made all of those things harder or impossible.",3284,1760385490.0

A story I heard from my father who lived in Leningrad in the 1960's light bulbs were rationed and always in short supply, so you had to take precautions to keep your light bulbs from being stolen. To prevent hoarding, the authorities made a rule that you could only get a new light bulb when your old light bulb burned out, and you had to present the old light bulb as proof. So even burned out bulbs had to be guarded against theft. If your bulb got stolen, what could you do? There was a weekend flea market where black market goods were sold. You could go there and buy a used, burned-out light bulb, which you could then use to buy a new one.",9514,1760373693.0
1o5n2u1,njbc7ua,"Not former Soviet republic, but a buffer state Czechoslovakia back then. Among other things, central planning and its long-term effects. Tldr - imagine you have a company and the state tells you how much you should pay, how you should calculate it, how you should anticipate next year and if it does not work out, it is your problem to meet the requirements of the state. People quickly learned that everything is someone else's fault and someone else's problem. It is of course not typical just to communismsocialism, but the state required huge amounts of data and was so obsessed wih its collection, that it than had no spare capacity to actually work with the data yes, I know, it is typical for a corporate world today, bear with me for a second. So usually you just took last year's data and made an assumption that this year would be better because communism marches forward, duh and set the plan. But this was made at the central level, usually with little regard to different conditions in different parts of a country, or some universal rule for more detailed planning was set. Specific example - Unified Agricultural Cooperative in Czech Jednotn zemdlsk drustvo, so I will be using the short JZD. JZD was supposed to be an independent agricultural unit where local people put together their land, machinery, cattle etc. and they all worked there division of labor, managed it together and then split profits fairly. Central rules dictated that it is supposed to be profitable enough that all people taking part in it would be well-off. So no debt allowed. Also a central rule stated that after a year ended, you sum up what you have earned and divide it among people. Fairly, so another rule - every kind of work had allocated work units for which you got paid - if you spend a day guarding geese, it was one work unit, if you were driving a harvester, it could be five work units I am not sure about the number here, but for the general idea. The end year profit was calculated per work unit, not per person. You see the problem - the people participating in JZD are not going to wait for a whole year to get paid. So it was for example assumed what that year's profits would be and there were central rules for it or you were even given the assumption, meaning that one work unit will be worth 2 crowns. So people were not actually paid each month, they received the money as a wage advance. At the end of the year, surprise surprise, the overall profit divided by work units meant that one work unit was worth only 1 crown bad year or bad initial assumption. So the people got overpaid and they were supposed to give back half of their year's pay. Of course nobody would do that, they were not paid well in the first place, and they thought that they are being robbed by someone higher up. It usually got resolved, but only because someone at the local level, but a bit higher up, was fighting the central hub in Prague through some back-channels and got it covered. So for ordinary people, as long as you put your head in the sand and refuse to give your money back, you get to keep it. For management of JZD, someone else will solve it and they will receive instructions on how to run their bussiness for next year. Zero accountability everywhere and that did not dissapear with the fall of the regime. If anyone reads in Czech, I highly recommend a book Mal doznn okresnho soudce by Ota Ul. It is full of stories like this one.",761,1760379661.0
1o5n2u1,njb6u3t,"Ukrainian, born in late 80s, so I've got mostly 2nd hand experience, but many vestiges of that system remained well into 00s and onwards. There was no equality in practice. The lifestyle of a blue collar worker may have been not that different from that of a non-military engineer, sure, but it was a very far cry from a party administrator. I'm not even talking about Central Committee or anything, just the local party youth organisation komsomol, a stepping stone into CPSU proper. Think 5x-10x the salary and, more importantly, great connections. So many things that couldn't be bought in stores were just a phone call away if you have the right number. Cars, services, foreign vacations, the best healthcare, you name it. As another example, there were ruble stores and Berezka foreign currency stores - think Soviet duty-free. Now guess who could buy dollars at the official exchange rate of 0.7 rublesUSD instead of 20 rublesUSD black market rate? And those junior party members went on to become the primary beneficiaries of privatisation - CEOs, MPs, X Democratic Party leaders etc. Money by itself may have meant less than it did in Western societies, but it basically just made the entire system even more corrupt and nepotistic. Can a colonel's son become general? - Of course not, the general has a son too. On free healthcare - good hospitals and good doctors were also the privilege of the powerful. Sure, you won't pay anything officially, but if you get something serious like a tumour, you and everyone you know would need to call in every favour to maybe get you into something like a military hospital to have a chance of being treated. Oh, and you couldn't just up and move to a bigger city if you're not happy with your life, or easily change careers. Kolkhoz collective farm workers didn't have internal IDs up until 1970.

For some years we could only buy a defined number of goods, like 600 grams of meat per month. Or one pair of shoes per year. If you needed a fridge, or furniture, or sth like that but not a dishwasher, there were NO dishwashers there was a line in which people waited for weeks. Well, not actually waited all the time, but there was a list of names in a notebook and you had to check you name every day with a person who had the notebook and was keeping the line. You missed a day for any reason? You are OUT. Then you got news that the shop will actually have delivery of e.g. fridges. and the last several days you actually waited 2424 alternating with family members. And then you bought whatever was in the shop, the model, color, size did not matter. And things were super expensive, like TV cost an annual salary. And if you managed to go abroad you felt REALLY poor, as your monthly salary was equal to 30 USD. A salesperson in a shop was way more important than a university professor.

This joke would have been considered hilarious by both the Westerners and the Soviet people, but for completely different reasons. For the Westerners, the joke is this silly foreigner is unable to understand recognize cheese. For the Soviets, the joke would have been understood as fantastical absurdity, because obviously it's impossible for a store to have so many different types of cheeses, it would be akin to portraying rivers flowing with wine instead of water, and streets being paved with pure gold. If a Soviet person saw a video so common in present day, where some overweight American complains about how poor they are, the Soviet person would have 100 assumed that this is satire. An overweight person complaining about poverty? That's some good humor! It's a common story from people who went to Western countries after the fall of the USSR, and visited a supermarket for the first time. They would often have an emotional breakdown and fall to their knees weeping, because the abundance they saw was literally unimaginable to them. I know a woman who when the first MCDonald's opened in our country, was afraid to visit it for years, not because she thought that she couldn't afford it, but because she thought that she wouldn't be let in and that would have been humiliating, because McDonald's seemed like such an unimaginable luxury that she couldn't believe that it would be accessible to the general public. 30 years later, McDonald's is considered shit, low-tier food, like everywhere else. That's the power of capitalism. It's so annoying and heartbreaking as someone from an ex-Soviet country to constantly read Westerners especially Americans complaining about capitalism and how they want capitalism to disappear.

1o5n2u1,njbm2z9,"I lived, but I was like 2 when the USSR fell apart and my country restored its independence so I can only say what my parents and grandparents have said. In some ways, USSR was just the same as any other society. You knew the right kinds of people youd get fancier higher quality stuff and rare hard to get stuff, but youd have to give something in return. Nepotism? Totally normal. Also revenge because your family didnt really follow communism or your uncle was a dissident or something? Yeah, good luck getting into a university and trying to get a better job and life as no university will admit you. Doctors earned the same wages as your shift brigadier at a factory. Cashiers and any kind of sales person was a GOOD job - you had contacts to get rare or hard to get stuff or even contraband and YOU were the kingqueen not the customer. Foreign travel? Most could forget about it. But you did have the whole USSR to travel to friendly socialist countries. But many families hardly ever traveled because 1 needed vacation time off work 2 needed a ticket to go to a fancy spa like resort and you couldnt get to those without actually having a ticket and you couldnt buy tickets, these were handed out at work and there was always a lot less than workers 3 gas was expensive and cars were not THAT common, buses-trains were main intercity mode of transport and 4 you needed to register at every place you went to at a local police station. But if you did travel abroad lets just say that East Germany was basically considered as the height of socialist development in my country. Now imagine how western countries must have appeared like since we know how east Germany actually was. Kids did learn English, but many actually learned German as a foreign language. Of course Russian wasnt foreign, but another state language. What people dont get is that yeah, there was socialized healthcare, medicine, childcare, even food cafeterias and housing. It was all basic and covered your needs. If you wanted bare minimum, you got it and had it. Plenty of people were very happy with it. But you most likely had the exact same carpet, furniture and tea set as your boss unless boss managed to buy something with a bribe or bring something from another socialist state. Many homes looked the same whether you had money or not. Your home was basic cookie cutter - many apartments were the same basically down to the tiles on the bathroom walls and wallpapers. Your clothes looked similar because they were made with the same fabric available at the store and sewn according to the same instructions from a sewing magazine. Your shoes were the same because the factory produced X number of models and for the whole Soviet Union maybe so they were the same. You and your neighbors most likely had the same type of telephone and car. Your friends had the same bed and desk set and the same pencils, crayons, pens etc. Everything was the same or similar because this massive industry produced stuff for everybody and yet it wasnt enough or it wasnt always good quality, just enough for a basic life. Your healthcare was okay, but you were lower than dirt as a patient at a hospital - literally at the lowest level, a cleaner was better than you. Also, many older people genuinely still think that you only got to into the hospital to die. If you had money, you didnt really have much to spend it on and generally you didnt have a lot of money. But you didnt have much to spend it on anyway so you didnt exactly feel poor, neglected or anything. You didnt know what to miss since you never had it. Also, the USSR was massive. Some things looked the same across the whole union - apartment buildings for example or kindergartens and schools, some food shops. And yet other things were massively different - food availability for example. Youd think that with such a large territory, everybody would have any kind of food available to them, right? But my grandparents and parents hardly ever got any foods from the other republics - I think mandarins, kiwis etc - were very rare things for them until late 1980s. At the best youd get some watermelon from Ukraine but not even that. So just because it was a big union didnt mean that youd actually get access to all these national foods or fruits and veg. Also how much money was just spent. Eg massive massive costs on some things that the state didnt care about which ended basically the day the independence was restored because suddenly the state did not have endless supply of money to print and pay for stuff.",102,1760382560.0

She asked me what she could get for 10 just to feed her kids. I paid for them to have unlimited salad bar out of my pocket, asked the kids what their fav pizza was and went in the back and made it for them. She kept apologizing for how loud her kids were and asked how long she could be there. The kids werent loud at all. They all just seemed scared. When I brought the pizza out for the kids, I told her I wanted to show her something at the salad bar she might like and once out of earshot of the kids I asked if she was okay or in danger or needed to call anyone. She just started crying and thanked me, her mom was going to pick them out but theyre some distance away. She asked if she could hug me and I said yes, because she needed it.

1o9bgpe,nk36txs,"Ok, this is going to take a bit. This all happened in 1988. SO I was in jail for a short time for something minor. Just a weekend stay. Anyways I heard on the TV in the day room that the police had been called last night because someone was up in a tree with a fork. A Fork? The next night I had a new guy in my cell and it was the guy with the fork. So he tells me the rest of the story. So he went into this pizzapasta place intending to dine and dash. He was eating pizza and drinking and was getting pretty drunk. The manager comes over and says they wouldn't serve him any more and he had to pay and leave. So buddy jumps up and grabs the waitress and a fork off the table. I guess the knife was to far away to get. He holds the fork at the girls neck and backs out of the restaurant. Once outside he lets the girl go and starts running up the road. The manager is running next to the guy and tells him that he the manager ran marathons on the weekend and buddy wasn't going to get away. So buddy decides to climb a tree to get away from the manager. He still has the fork and is threating the manager with it. The cops come and surround the tree and tell buddy to come down and drop the fork. Buddy says fuck you, go ahead and shoot me. btw this is in Canada so the cops don't shoot him. Finally he gets tired of hanging from the tree and comes down. They put him in remand for the rest of the weekend, which is where I got the story from him.",68,1760759531.0

I was so afraid of having to pay the bill out of my own pocket I was still in college and its worth like 3 shifts of work I came back to the restaurant, stood by their table and just stared into space. The other customers asked me whats wrong and I told them a group left without paying and idk what to do. The owner kept the bill open and didnt make me pay for it. Turns out the customer that asked me whats wrong found one of the guys at that table. Next day he came over to pay and apologized.

Then had his second aneurysm last week, this time I was around and luckily got him to the hospital in less than 8 minutes, same area of his brain erupted. Got attended by the same neurologist, he was looking at him and me like we were aliens, most people just die while we just laughed it off cause what else are you going to do.

Felt a small pop in my stomach not even painful just odd feeling. next thing I know im on the bathroom floor vomiting blood for 10 hours while my family was sleeping. I couldn't even stand to reach the phone. If my sister didn't find me in the morning I would be dead.my mom bless her heart just thought i had the flu and told me to drink fluids and go lay down I would have died my sister seen the bucket of blood though and rushed me to the er. I collapsed in the parking garage and I had emergency surgery for a burst fallopian tube. Doctors said I almost lost all the blood I had in my body. If i waited any longer i wouldn't have made it.

Built in shelves are literally functional - they allow you to retain floor space because a closet like one you buy at Ikea sticks out from the wall and has a width, that monopolizes that space and causes it to be less functional. Show home, lived in home these distinctions are meaningless. You either like to live in chaos or you don't, if you don't then you live in a way that is conducive to fast cleaning and organizing. That means no knick knacks, hutches full of dishes you use once every 5 years are gone, old clothes are gone, furniture that goes unused is gone, etc. We millenials grew up with boomer parents who would collect every goddamn thing, put wall to wall carpets over beautiful old wood floors, they singularly kept the hutch business from collapsing, they couldn't sell enough gold wood to boomers, apparently boomers never knew your white balance could trend to blue. Is it a bit of an overreaction to that? Maybe, but I like this way better. As an aside, and I know this is true for me, I grew up in a typical upper midwest rust belt kind of home in the 80s and 90s.

Can be found easier and faster by googling than by asking in the sub reddit How long is the event for it literally says IN THE GAME At some point people are just being annoying and need to learn to lean on their own minds a little more.

Things that are dying and squirt blood. Halloween night it would look sick, but during the day neighbors were complaining. The nosey side of the neighborhood apparently chewed their ears off for it and were knocking down their door. They did their best to make it look more campy and less bloody.

Equivalent to getting into big tech as an engineer where you will be making 200k out of university. And be able to be earning 300-500k 5 years in. Also your 200k in finance is going to be in a high cost of living area. Whereas engineers can earn higher pay relative to cost of living in smaller cities.

A lot of them are in industrial plants and are further out from other spots. WFH is also very uncommon in plant support roles. The on-call also sucks.

And sales roles often pay better than absolutely anyone else in the business in the good years and still pretty good in bad years as the base salary is alright. The last sales guys I worked with had base salaries of 80k-100k but commissions were 1 of sales with sales targets in the 10M to 30M range. One guy got a 120M sale. Not sales total, but a single sales contract for 120M among his other sales for the year. If you want money as your primary target, go into industrial sales... Or windows. Windows guys can make insane commissions. Anyway, engineers are often paid much higher than the regional average where the role is located and they, and their families, are very comfortable financially. That's not something to sneer at. But yes, your earning potential is limited compared to other top degreed positions. Honestly, I often wonder if I should have just gone into roofing.

If you know your spouse's favourite colour, pick a high-value gemstone for that. Simple example Cornflower blue Sapphire with good C's will retain its value and also climb in price like gold over time. Also easily more expensive than a diamond if someone cares about a big price tag.

Objectively, they worked in the first term, as Republicans lost big in the 2018 midterms and Trump lost in 2020 and the Senate even narrowly flipped blue, which if you recall was seen as a real long shot at the time. But that strategy fell apart after the 2020 wins for a few reasons. 1 Biden became unpopular within six months of taking office rather than becoming a FDR-like transformative figure as he imagined 2 The GOP didn't abandon Trump after the 2020 loss and Jan. 6, like the Biden Dems expected, and therefore didn't revert to normal and 3 The party failed to recognize that a sort of return to normalcy message which worked in 2020 -- when people were really tired of chaos wrought by Trump -- wasn't going to work in 2022 and 2024 when you're the party in charge.",180,1760488939.0

You notice how a lot of this administrations actions are currently unpopular even among its base? Dont you think its odd that all of the article headlines and social media feeds are full of Dems alienated young males or Dem party is falling apart or both sides bad when so much turmoil and suffering is happening under the current admin? Its intentional. It empowers MAGA while disillusioning anyone else paying attention. You even see it with the conservatives going against Trump like MTG or Tucker Carlson. They say they disagree about this or that from this administration, but at the end of the day they still support Trump. Best case scenario they realign conservatives and independents to keep voting for MAGA or worst case scenario they convince them to give up and sit out the next few elections.

But, we could discuss other politicians going far lower in private to harm the American people, sell out jobs, economically, etc which is far worse, but thats a discussion for another time. Back to the topic at hand. The reality is, my entire life, Ive been pretty much moderate, center right. All Ive ever heard is how dumb republicans are Clinton called them deplorables, etc. Every bit of pop culture and almost all news was anti anything conservative no matter what. across all areas of life its been a known thing to just sort of be a quiet conservative or you will likely be lambasted by people on the far left, hated, or at the very least misunderstood with no desire from them to have an open discussion to find common ground. Now, its only gotten worse. Now if youre conservative, youre a Nazi. Full stop, Youre hate filled. Your business should be set a blaze and abandoned Twitter, Tesla, etc. Your very identity as a rational personor even a person is removed. When that personhood is removed, you end up with assasinations like Charlie Kirk and the ones attempted on the pres. FWIW, most moderate republicans didnt even like Trump when he first came around. I certainly didnt vote for him the first time. The media created him because they gave him all the air time so they could sell ad space. At the end of the day, I think it has far less to do with going high and more just getting the job done. The current generation is doing quantifiably worse than their parents for the first time in Americas history. Thats BOTH sides of the aisle fault, and None of that was clearly changing and people wanted change. Trump, ultimately, is barely a Republican at all, he is more of a representative of an outside figure coming to change the system. Most of the people who teamed up with him were Dems anyway. Im not saying hes succeeding, but its obvious to anyone watching it NEEDS to change. Trillions in debt and no real ideas to change it.

Michelle Obama even said this verbatim. Basically, the idea was that Trump's a massive asshole, which is true, so let's be moral and righteous in the face of that. If this was said, it most assuredly wasn't followed through on. From what I saw and experienced, the Dems didn't go high, there was maybe half a year of standard fair after which people just lost their minds and went into hysterical fits over the tinniest things. The go high when they go low strategy can't have failed if it wasn't actually attempted. And the idea that the media highlights Dem foibles and scandals more than Republicans is, frankly, a mind boggling take given how much coverage of Republican, and especially Trump, related news there was between 2017 and 2020.",2,1760528346.0

When they pushed to turn a run of the mill fine for campaign finance violation into a felony. That was going low.

I do agree that a lot of activist communications tend to lean more towards the first one, and there isn't enough of the second one. However, I don't necessarily think that all instances of the first need to be more like the second -- each has its place. I also think that it's likely that many leftists have become disillusioned with attempting to achieve the second, feeling like the modern right isn't open to seeing their viewpoint at all, so there's not much use in bothering. I personally don't fully agree with this I think there are definitely many more non-extreme right-wingers than most people think who could definitely come to see eye-to-eye with left-wing ideals if they were simply given the right resources and explanations, but many left-wingers either don't believe these people exist, don't believe they exist in any substantial enough quantities, or simply don't have the energy left to bother thinking about it and would rather focus their energy elsewhere.

My personal experience is that progressives are very well aware that the other side exists and disagrees with them. It's just that they tend not to believe that moderates or independents exist at all, and that everything is a battle between good and evil - and so when they encounter somebody who isn't a Republican who still doesn't agree with them, they write them off as secret closet Republicans.

You should be able to dispute an arrest, if you believe its unfair. the complete opposite of this is happening. The law wasnt changed via normal processes. In fact it wasnt even changed.

1o79x95,njngjnw,"I think it's a bit more complicated. The left has more working against them than the right. Everything you pay attention to, learn, experience, process, etc. shapes your perceptionworldview. Since we are all paying attention to, learning, and experiencing different things, we all experience the world through different lenses. You can be in the same room with someone, technically experiencing the same thing, but your experience and interpretation of that moment could be radically different. This has been exacerbated by the internet, which is a firehose of information often out of context, misinformation, disinformationpropaganda, as well as more people having higher education, more exposure to different people's ideas and experiences, etc. No one knows what another person believes, has experienced, is educated about, etc. unless you get to know that person on a deeper level. The right wing base tends to be whiter, more male, more rural, less educated, more religious, etc. The left wing base tends to be more multiculturalethnically diverse, more urban, more educated, more female, etc. This means that the right is able to pander to the lowest common denominator. There's a reason why the right talks a lot about common sense. They think that everyone else experiences the world the same way that they do, and because they typically have a more limitedone dimensional understanding of how the world works, their solutions to problems usually oversimplify or misunderstand the problem. It's a lot easier to convince someone that we need to mass deport immigrants when a they feel their own circumstances worsening, b they see an increase in visible minorities from different cultures and speaking different languages. There is a connection between these two things, but its a correlation, not a causation, but those in power benefit from people's ignorance. There's a reason why the right wing thinks that going to collegeuniversity is liberal indoctrination and why those in power have directed the right's disdain particularly towards social sciences and the humanities i.e. woke. The right wing benefits from people having a poor understanding of history and society. Higher education exposes you to a wide range of ideas, as well as a wide range of people that they would not have been exposed to if they stayed in, say, a predominately white small town. This exposure to a variety of people, experiences, ideas, etc. also has the effect of increasing empathy in higher education and in urban settings. If your roommate is an immigrant, your friends have different experiences and views on the world, and you take courses that expose you to a variety of perspectives, including those of people who aren't white, straight, male, Christian, conservatives , you're more likely to develop empathy to people who are different from you and who may have pieces to life's puzzle that you don't have rather than seeing them as outsiders and being distrusting of outgroups. Left wing ideas generally involve power analysis and understanding the larger systemsstructures shape our lives. Right wing ideas tend to be about rugged individualism. This automatically makes a lot of left wing ideas more difficult to understand, because not everyone learns how to engage in systemic thinking or apply it consistently. Left-wing policies tend to be more evidence-based whereas right-wing policies are tend to be more based on emotion and values at least on the surface. Both the Democrats and the Republicans represent their wealthy donors and corporations over regular people. This means that there is not a left wing party, and there aren't very many wealthy people who want to back people who tend towards anti-capitalism and fighting for human rights for everyone. This means that real leftist ideas are not widespread Republicans, Democrats, and mainstream media generally don't do much class analysis, and when left wing ideas are presented, they are typically a caricature or misrepresented or dismissed as unrealistic see Bernie Sanders, who was largely ignored by mainstream media, despite all his grassroots support, and who in 2020, MSNBC Host Chris Matthews suggested indirectly might execute people in Central Park if elected. Since most people aren't deeply political and due to propaganda, a lot of people don't even differentiate between the left and Democrats which makes it easier to think that left wing policies don't work, as their policies are usually only half measures and still benefit the wealthy and corporations more than regular people. The internet exposes us to a lot of different ideas, but those ideas are often out of context and require background information to understand. So like, two people could be debating a topic on reddit and one might have a PhD in the topic and the other might be a high school student. The high school student is not likely to have the educationlife experience to understand the topic on the same level as the person with the PhD. Or even if its not a debate and you're simply reading someone else's perspective or conversations between other people and the content assumes the reader has a more in depth perspective. Not all content is going to have a 101 explainer because people want to engage in deeper conversations than that. The right wing used their resources to propagandize heavily regarding culture war topics. This really took off during Gamergate in 2014. A lot of right wing influencers made a lot of money making anti-SJW content, taking someone from the left who is passionate and angry, may be a poor spokesperson for the movement, may be taken out of context or misrepresented, or that they or their audience don't have the background knowledge to understand. So basically Right wing Backed by wealthy donors, appeals to low informationlow education voters who are more susceptible to propaganda, more homogenous and more likely to be made up of the dominant groups, more responsive to fear mongering and appeals to emotion and religion, and more likely to agree with simple, common sense solutions. Left wing More likely to require a deeper education to understand or to have lived experience i.e. navigating the world as a minority or a woman. They are more likely to be people targeted by the right wing's policies. Less resources to get their message out there. Lots of well-funded propaganda against them. Supported policies tend to be evidence-based and propaganda has made a lot of people distrustful of academics and may not be apparent to the average person, may require more upfront costs, bigger change, and the positive outcomes may not be evident in the short-term also you have to convince a wider range of people that its in their interest to work together for all of our best interests in a society that is very individualized. So my argument is basically that no one knows what other people know unless you get to know them on a deeper level. The right wing has an easier time appealing to common sense and emotions. The left wing has more of a challenge because you need more building blocks to understand left wing ideas and policies. And while some people on the left have been swayed through emotion and fear appeals to empathy, for example, because the left wing cares about policy and ideas that actually work to improve the lives of people, they also care more about being rooted in reality. The left is also trying to reach more diverse people and have less access to resources to facilitate that reach. Successful organizing requires you to meet people where they are at in terms of understanding, engagement, and location, and its a more complicated and longer road for the left. We can't just appeal to fear, emotion, God, the Bible, nationalism, whitemale supremacy, lower taxes, etc. the way the right can. With the right being more religious and a lot of their leaders jumping on the Trump train, the religious right has natural community through their churches, homeschool groups, etc. where they are taught the same things as each other. Since capitalism is increasingly eroding community, and because we need to reach people from many different walks of life including different religions and no religion, we have to intentionally create our own community spaces, convince people to come, and ensure that the spaces are welcoming for as many people as possible and balancing making it a safe space for marginalized groups, while also making it a place where people can learn and grow and make mistakes, can be a difficult tightrope to navigate.",5,1760547872.0

The intuitive way to understand defund the police is abolish the police . The activist left went all in on this slogan for a period. How did voters respond ? In New York City a bastion of left wing politics, after months of protestors chanting defund the police , voters responded by voting for Eric Adams, an ex cop, who promised more not less police spending. Those protests utterly backfired, despite police brutality remaining a severe problem. Supporting common sense restrained policing would have gotten you labelled a supporter of Jack booted thugs and fascism by this group in this period. B Latinx for a period every left wing activist and journalist glommed onto this phrase, seemingly everyone in the democratic Party machine was using this word except hilariously one specific group actual Latinos. This word seems rightly dead today, but in the half decade it was popular how much damage did the party do with Latino voters, many of whom swung to voting Republican. In this period if you did use Latino a loud minority would have torn into you for being sexist. Ridiculous. C Gender issues. Activists have generally taken an absolutist position that runs counter to common sense by the bulk of working class society. I despise Trump, and the people behind him but when their campaign released the slogan Kamala is for theythem, Trump is for YOU it was absolute genius, and captured the way the democratic activist class had gotten completely disconnected from the reality of its working class voter base and that voting base's values.

Then it seems you are not engaging with what people are protesting against. The issues are the tactics. The idea of masked, armed men jumping out of cars and grabbing people off the street in order to deport them without any trial is horrifying. The idea that the military is being sent, not at the request of the state, but at the direction of the president is insane. Let's take it a step further.

1o79x95,njn08k4,"Generally speaking, the American right doesn't speak to the left. There isn't really a channel through which this convincing can happen. Right wing media figures generally only play with home team advantage, or against college students. With rare exception, you won't find serious debates between the big right wing influencerspoliticians and the big left wing influencerspoliticians. Let alone Fox, which at this point are just Party Political Broadcasts. There are left leaning news channels attempting a kind of neutrality, but its arguably a bit irresponsible because it's not reciprocated - so polarisation is logical. With all that said, there's also another crucial issue - who are the left? If you mean the Democrats, Biden tried to pass a bilateral immigration bill with a lot of Republican input. Republicans shot the bill down and delayed actual legislation on the immigration issue for a year or so. So you kind of have a multiplicity of issues here and you can pretty much put all of them at the feet of the current insanity in the US right. - Right generally won't talk to Left even in the form of debate given neutral moderation even numbers - Republicans generally won't do bipartisanship since Obama regardless of the issue - An unprecedented lack of decorum and respect on behalf of the President and party in general makes the base hostile to Democrats and more insularcultish generally Under these conditions, attempting to engage in good faith is basically self harm, all downside. It's better just to focus on effective activism than contend with a national scale echo chamber. Consensus building and bipartisan problem solving requires cooperation, but current US politics are fundamentally adversarial. Can you even imagine Trump or another key figure sitting down to seriously discuss drawbacks of their policy with anyone at any time, let alone a Democrat? Finally, what is activism? To me, activism is trying to make a difference on the ground. There are ENDLESS youtube videos, documentaries, literature reviews, papers, university debates etc etc discussing immigration, climate, guns, abortion. At what point may activists begin actual activism? Is there a threshold of agreement that must be reached?

1o79x95,njoubrv,"The border issue is not black and white. I sometimes think the right wishes the left were wholly, 100 against any kind of border enforcement because it would make their messaging easier and it would make their opponents a easier target for scorn and ridicule. Podcast and talk radio pundits can craft whatever narrative they like about the protestors. Who really knows what each protestor believes unless you talk to them? Perhaps many of them will tell you they want the hardened violent criminals to be deported or that there should be stronger enforcement at the border, but they don't like students being arrested for opinion blog posts. Maybe some of them wouldn't even call themselves left-wing -- perhaps they are for lower taxation but also feel passionate about civil rights. What do you think they believe? How do you know? As for whether protests are effective, would segregation have ended without the civil rights protests? Would the US have entered more protracted and costly wars in the 1970s and 1980s if the Vietnam War protests didn't happen? Would the USSR have lasted longer if it weren't for mass protests against communist autocrats? Protesting will always make some people uneasy because it challenges the status quo and certainty in their daily lives -- that tomorrow will be like yesterday. People's attentional budgets are so limited that protest is the only way to know that someone actually cares about a given issue. Sometimes that initial irritation, after reflection, turns into support. Republicans who once derided OIF protestors now regard the war as a failure and campaign on non-interventionism. There was a time when Republicans and Democrats talked about immigration. There was a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 called the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Reform Act of 2013. It would have greatly expanded border enforcement before the mass migration waves mid-decade. In fact, it would have funded 40,000 new, permanent border patrol officers. This would have given CBP the resources to prevent the inflow of illegal border crossings over the past decade. However, it also would have streamlined a lot of the bureaucracy for legal immigration, improved efficiency, and decreased processing times for people following the rules. It would have punished the misuse of the H1B visa program and provided more enforcement teeth. Certain critical need grads who met certain stringent eligibility requirements would have been able to apply for green cards. A merit-based, points immigration system would have been created to prioritize skilled work visas with broad coverage of different professions across all industries. A new W visa would have gated the entrance of low skill workers, requiring them to be strongly vetted. The bill had strong bipartisan support. It would tighten the border while creating sound standards for legal immigration and removing bureaucratic bottlenecks. Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham co-sponsored the bill, made substantial changes to it that had President Obama's backing. It passed the Senate 68-32. Many House Republicans supported it. For a moment, it seemed the bill would coast through the House until it didn't. Ultimately, the House leadership let the bill die without a floor vote. A decade of congressional obstinance on any meaningful immigration reform followed -- this must be a factor in the migration problem metastasizing. Is the problem that the left needs to go back to the drawing board? Does congressional obstinance have anything to do with it? Do you think there is any credence to the idea that the administration wants to make legal immigration illegal so they have a pretext to deport legal immigrants? To what extent do you think it is reasonable to expand interpretation of Article II executive powers? Is the 100K H1B fee a tax or is a legitimate cost to process an H1B application?

1o8t3nc,nk10rn9,"So there are criminal penalties, if there's a pattern. But importantly, civil and criminal penalties are leveled with different burdens of proof. Criminal penalties require the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Civil penalties merely require a preponderance of the evidence. That makes it far easier to punish people for hiring undocumented immigrants, specifically because you don't have to prove the knowingly portion with such rigor. It's actually very difficult bar to clear. But once there is a pattern established through civil penalties, those penalties will certainly help establish the knowingly prong required for criminal burden. We can't change the burden of proof standards for just a single crime, it's kind of an all or nothing deal. The question really is about whether the knowingly portion should need to be a prong of the offense at all. It sounds like you want some sort of negligent standard instead. But I would disagree. The offense of giving someone money as part of a consensual contract just isn't a big enough deal to establish such strict liability. Hiring an undocumented immigrant is not drinking and driving - you're not risking anyone's life or health. You're just not doing paperwork properly that's biggest drawback is you just gave someone money that the government doesn't want living here for largely political reasons. I also want to point out reducing the standard for criminality could backfire against Americans as well. There are Americans that don't have a passport or social security card and have to rely on lesser known documents. The other C documents, like Native American Tribal Documents are ones that Americans in general are less familiar with. Enforcing criminal penalties on small employers for negligence may incentivize employers to be unwilling to hire employees that rely on documents that the employers are unsure about - resulting in unintentional discrimination.",1,1760730967.0

Part of that is a cheap labor market from uncontrolled immigration. Uncontrolled immigration helps business owners by suppressing labor costs.

Preferred companies would do well while the overall economy would eventually suffer horribly, IMO. Long term, the economy becomes very average and weak compared to our past.

Much of the entertainment industry is very liberal either by the people producing it or the content of the media and by what the consumers want. Disney and others would have severely curtailed profits under fascism. So it's not possible for new entertainment companies to appear if the current ones are going out of business? There's no basis for the assumption that the entertainment industry would just collapse if liberal media was censored or not tolerated. There would be new companies or existing ones that lack your moral fortitude that would be making acceptable media. What makes you think technical workers who are citizens will be threatened by the government at all? As I pointed out above many fascist states have had highly competent and successful technical industries. There's no real evidence that either threatening is a feature of fascism for technical professionals or even if it were that it makes a significant impact in output. I have no interest in living in a fascist government, but one of the things that does flourish under fascism at least in the short to moderate term is private companies. Sure some of them die, mostly if they fail to join the party, but private industry is supported and the government will protect important industries much more seriously than a free market economy like we currently have. The real problem with Fascism isn't any of the stuff above, it's the fact that it's a centrally planned system. Centrally planned systems have structural weaknesses to unexpected andor poorly understood disruptions to their economies. This usually takes decades to manifest in a seriously damaging way though. In the meantime well planned systems can be extremely successful.",10,1760367591.0

Also inside the corporations, who should make that decision. The stockholders are fine as long as the money flows.

Someone might say that you must hate fish, but actually from your perspective there are more important things at stake than than issue. Someone might say that doesn't matter because the way they define Fish Hating includes when someone does anything that even indirectly harms fish or even if they do nothing and their lack of action doesn't help fish in some way. From their fish-focused point of view it kind of makes sense, but from your I-wasn't-really-even-thinking-about-fish point of view it seems like a weird non sequitur. You don't care about fish particularly, or you do care but you think the tradeoff is worth it for now, or you have some more sophisticated take about how much fishing in the region is optimal for the fish population, or whatever. From your own perspective it doesn't make sense at all to think of yourself as a Fish Hater.

Sometimes that law is poorly written with other bad consequences. Sometimes its packaged with other things that they were against. 3 'Want women to return to 'traditional roles'' is again vague. What is tangible in their platform? Assuming they are against women's rights, is it fair to say everyone voting for them is misogynist? 4 I don't think I support this either, though it partially depends. There are many reasons to vote for a party, there are many single issue voters. Lets pretend this party is also the most green party, taking climate change seriously and voter X thinks this is the most important issue in the world. I think it would be wrong to conclude X is a misogynist. That title is only fairly applied to people who hold misogynistic opinions. The depends is on how prominent the parties' anti women platform is. It could be a major component or such a small part that no one expects them to really act on much and thus it can be overlooked.

Now let's assume we have a person Kyle obsessed with trains. Party L doesn't like trains and wants them decomissioned, but supports women's rights. Party R wants to fund more trains, but wants women as second-class citizens. Kyle votes for Party R. Now, I would argue that Kyle is NOT a misogynist. He has no hatred, dislike, or prejudice towards women. He simply valued trains more than women's rights. Same with the hypothetical person you suggest. If he votes for a misogynistic party because they lower his taxes, he's not himself a misogynist technically.

While the AfD does have sexist positions, as you mentioned, that has never been their main focus or emphasis. I wonder how many AfD voters are even familiar with their opinions on these issues at all, and if you would do a poll of the main reasons why AfD voters vote for them, I doubt gender-related issues would even be listed in the top five. Obviously the number one issue would be immigration, but even things like objecting to environmental policy or opposing support for Ukraine would take priority. In a party-based system, many voters focus on certain issues and vote for parties based on this. They then either ignore other issues or view their option as the lesser evil, if they are even familiar with the other issues at all. One could argue that womens issues are important enough that everyone should research these issues and weight them highly and as a woman, I agree, but I think it is a stretch to say that anyone who doesnt do so is a misogynist. It would be a different case, in my opinion, if the sexist opinions were the main focus of the party, but that isnt the case here.",1,1760901320.0

Title IX, nominally intended to combat sexual discrimination in schools, is rarely or never used to help boys, and is in fact weaponized against trans women. Everyone except for cis women would be better off without it. The wider anti-trans panic was started by feminists in the 70s women's lib movement and enjoys bipartisan support today. Trump's most successful advertisements were his anti-trans Super Bowl ads. He ended up gaining the support of 53 of white women. Are the majority of white women misogynists in your view, or is something else happening? We had an era, actually a couple of decades long, where men regularly complained that feminism was bigoted against them. They were ridiculed for this, even as the prison population sharply increased, even while schools and media openly favored cis women, and even today. Their complaints were not once taken seriously. If there's no way to convince cis women to overturn title IX, to repeal mandatory minimums, to treat their sons as well as they treat their daughters, to oppose child support it is slavery, and to stop false rape accusations -- and there seems to be no way to reach them -- then cis women should be prevented from voting, allowing the adults to solve these problems.

Also, if they express a viewpoint for a traditional family, but don't attach that to an law or action of the state, that's just an opinionadvice that doesn't impact rights in any way.

1o88eun,njuvmwb,"Whether or not this changes your view, I want to share something that I wish I understood an internalized much earlier in life. You're changing monthly if not weekly or daily when you're young and still figuring out life. That's observably true in settings like high school and college. What people won't tell you is that it continues into your twenties thirties forties fifties, you're changing until the day you die, constantly becoming the person who you will be next. It feels like we're simultaneously sold two lies 1. People don't really change 2. That we can Settle down when we finally realize who we are and what we want. You hear a lot of 1 from people getting out of fractured relationships. What they are really saying is I wanted this person to be somebody else, and they weren't willing to be that. It could be as simple as more organized or less of a slob. It's so obvious to you, why don't they see how they could just do better and it would make life easier for them and you! But the truth is people are constantly changing, which ties into 2, and your cmv. They're just changing because they want to, there's an intrinsic motivation, not an extrinsic penalty. One of the reasons why really good couples divorce between year 5 and 12 is that despite having children, buying a house, planning a future, having so much shared life together, what's also happening is you have two adults who are still changing, and those newly drifted-apart humans are no longer aligned enough to stay partners. They were both changing, but they weren't in tune with each other's changes. They'll see all the bad changes in their partner, and perhaps point to the good changes they've made. Scumbag human brain, this is an evolutionary adaptation. For your girlfriend, it sounds like she's on the front end of this. She's worried she'll miss out on experiences because she's tied down. There are also a lot of women who experience this in their early forties after starting families and feeling like they are stuck. Men tend to experience this too as a midlife crisis, but they're less likely to look at the marriage as an anchor. It's a human condition, that feeling never truly leaves us. So the reason your view is worth updating is the same reason the inverse is also wrong, or at least incomplete. The only way our relationship survives, at any age, at any stage, is if you have two people changing in harmony. They you have to continue to be curious and patient with who the other person is becoming. And it's not even themselves former you, insofar as the person who met their changing partner 4 years ago, it's the new person you've become being in tune with the new person they've become. The best way to visualize this is four distinct people in stages of metamorphosis. And that repeats in perpetuity. If the grass doesn't get watered, it does start to look greener elsewhere. But it's never the same grass as what was planted. And it's difficult to not internalize it, but often times break-ups are natural bbecause of this constant evolution. I really wish this weren't the case after marriage, because it's very hard on children, and usually both partners. But the most important thing you can do is find a partner who you can change with, to be curious and passionate toward, and stop thinking about settling down like a destination you both arrive at and stay.

We actually fulfilled both sides of your argument too we traveled numerous times a year tropical islands, national parks, west coast, east coast, whatever. We bought property too, starting with a condo in a expensive metropolitan city in the US and then a nice SFH in the suburbs.

1o88eun,njt4joj,"I somewhat agree with you, BUT... Parenthood is a trap. It is much harder to casually experience the joys of life if you are nurturing an infant or making sure a toddler isn't about to accidentally maim themselves. Even parents of high school kids have a ton of obligations, if they're trying to be good parents and set their kids up for success. They'll be enrolling them in after school programs, chauffeuring them around, networking with parents of friends, etc. It really is not the same as being single or building your own career. I'm childless by choice, in my 40s. My social circle is mostly childless adults in their 30s-50s, with a few adults whose children are teenagers or adults. Any of my friends who've had young babies now struggle to stay connected with people like me. Their entire life revolves around raising the next generation. That's how it should be, but it is NOT a choice to make lightly. It's a massive responsibility and a lot of sacrifice. And people have different priorities in what they want out of life. If family is among your top priorities, then yes, it is better to start young, and everything you said in your post is true. But if your top priority is a career in entertainment or art, then family is going to be a major drag on that ambition, and it is best to put it off until your career is established or until you gave it your best attempt. Other people might be prioritizing a career in medicine, or athletics, or they want fame and fortune as an entrepreneur. Or maybe they place a high priority on exploration via travel. All of these things are very difficult to achieve or establish with kids. I know a professional ballerina who put off having kids until her 30s. Dancers cannot work while pregnant and changes in their body shape does have a major impact on their career.

By exploring, I mean I have 3 college degrees paid for, a career Ive been nurturing for over 20 years, a paid for roof over my head, ample savings, etc., etc. At this stage in my life I have a lot of autonomy and plenty of resources to explore, experience, focus on my health, happiness, and hobbies. I can travel, create, recreate, volunteer, etc., to my hearts content. Granted, I was blessed with decent health, and longevity I have not met my demise yet, as so many young people assume they will before they reach middle age, knock on wood. Im sharing this to say that you absolutely can start exploring at any age, and in fact, its not always true that exploring while youre young, before youve established yourself, is objectively better, easier, or more fulfilling. You also dont have to live a child free life, like me, before you can enjoy exploring. At my age, what Im seeing among my peers is, their kids are grown and mostly out of the house, and now the fairly amicable divorces are a trend among those couples who stayed together for the kids, but decided they werent that into each other after all, and would like to start their second life. I have some friends who have been married and divorced several times, and are back out in the dating world or out adventuring solo. I have friends who coupled up with someone new after their divorces, and are living their best self adventuring together, and enjoying their newly extended family connections. Not every family is a traditional family. There are so many flavors out there. Theres something for everyone, and theres no shame in choosing whatever path works best for you, and not spending too much time and energy trying to fit into a mold that doesnt suit you.

There just aren't that many people in their thirties and forties who want the same thing, so it is much harder to do during that period of life.

Settling down before you feel like you've explored to gain enough self-understanding feels backwards to some people. How can you know that you've picked the right relationship for yourself when you haven't experienced other relationships? Are you getting married or having kids with your partner because they're the best person for you, or because you think they're the best person for you until you regret everything two years later? If you know there are things you want to experience before you feel ready to settle down, staying in a relationship that prevents you from experiencing these things is counter-productive.",17,1760627060.0

You dont always have that stuff in order when you start dating young. Some do, you sound like you do. She didnt value starting a family early.

1o88eun,njuj7uv,"This is not the mainstream experience, but I'll share mine. I was raised a pastor's kid in the US evangelical bubble and purity culture of the 90's and 00's. I met my wife at a Christian college and we got married at 21. I am now 36. I've since deconstructed my faith and no longer consider myself Christian. Being in the culture at the time, my wife and I didn't so much as kiss until we dated for 7 months. We had sex for the first time on our wedding night. I've had a hard wired spanking fetish since I can remember. If you don't know much about it, it's almost like it's own sexual orientation, and people refer to themselves as 'spankos'. It's not just a 'preference' but a very specific longing for connection. Given my lack of sexual experience I thought it was a common thing. My wife and I did discuss it before we got married, but all she could really say was that she'd try it. It turned out she hated it and wanted nothing to do with it, and it was a source of bitter arguments and resentment for almost 14 years. On top of that, purity culture in general really fucked things up for us and we had to go back and unlearn a lot of unhealthy patterns around sex in general. Even with therapy, I couldn't make the fetish go away, and I felt like I was trapped. It became this cycle of shame, trying to give it up, only to have it resurge and cause frustration and temptations to cheat which I never acted on. I felt anger and grief that I had to hide such a core part of myself from my own partner. For her, she felt like she wasn't good enough and couldn't make me happy. It was a mess. Along the way we discovered she is autistic, so sensory issues and anxiety are a big factor, and those just can't be fixed. It felt like gridlock. Things finally came to a head last year where we finally reached the point of just feeling too sexually incompatible to stay married. We have two kids and splitting up over such a specific thing that just wouldn't fit just felt heartbreaking, especially after all the work we put into our relationship. I felt like I tried everything to make it go away. That was when we finally found a sex positive non-christian therapist and learned that there are other ethical options to get those needs met from others outside the marriage with boundaries in place. It's been a big factor in me finally leaving the faith system I was raised in, and branching out to discover other perspectives on ethical sex. It's been a complete game changer for us. Negative patterns we had for over a decade started to fade away. My wife and I even talk about my experiences and she feels no jealousy because we are more secure than ever in our bond. I love her dearly, but it would have saved us both so much pain if I had explored and affirmed that part of me early on so I could have met someone who shares that, because it did not go away and only got more desperate the older I got. What we have now works but I still wish it could be her, and it's not the solution I would have preferred or chosen. I'm thankful for where things are now, but I feel robbed of the time in my 20's and early 30's where I had to repress such a core part of myself.",5,1760642859.0

The reason people say explore is because you generally change radically between 18 and 40. Those young adult years people shift who they are. What they believe. What they like. What they want. I knew I had seen a ton of the world when I married at 18. Far more than people that were 80 in many cases. But I didn't know how much I would still change in some ways. Politically I went from Conservative to Liberal. Religiously I went from Christian to Atheistic. What didn't change was my not wanting kids. My experience living in different areas opened my mind to where I wanted to settle. At 36 I am still changing more and deciding how my future will look but I am happy my husband changed with me. That is rare. On the other hand my sister in law and brother in law have 4 kids and now they deeply regret becoming a parent and are getting a divorce. They bought into the myth of the middle class white picket fence and hated it. At 41 she is single for the first time in 2 decades so now she is exploring what she could have been.

1o88eun,njtvbnm,"The key to exploration is discovery and experience. Saving discovery and experience for late in life means you are making uninformed decisions prior to that learned knowledge. You may also close down paths along the way by waiting too long to explore those things such as hiking in the alps is easier at 24 vs 54. While she may be happy with spending evenings with you on the couch watching your favorite show, she may be even happier as a single woman not tied down exploring Europe with friends and meeting lovers. Maybe not. For some reason she is questioning what will make her happiest though and its better to work out those feelings now Vs breaking up a family in the future. Another way to put it.. her favorite ice cream may be vanilla flavored since thats all shes ever tried. But turns out her favorite is actually pistachio and vanilla doesnt even compare. She was happy with the vanilla until she tried the pistachio and realized theres a whole world out there of other flavors she hasnt tried and wants to see what else shes missed out on. And maybe her favorite dessert isnt even ice cream, but is macarons pistachio macarons. Of course she couldve lived her whole life just eating vanilla ice cream and have been okay, but its sad to think she may have missed out on pistachio macarons her whole life if she never decided to order something new. In the worst case for her, she tries out new ice cream flavors and desserts and doesnt like the much. Turns out she was a vanilla girl all along.

At 40 I am not the same person I was at 25. Your tastes get refined. You figure out what you like and what you want in a partner, a career, out of life in general.

To become formidable and to really figure out what kind of person she wants to be or what kind of anything anything is really... I know it seems like an excuse to go out and get wild and just slut around or maybe things like that, but truly, a person doesn't want to feel like they go from childhood straight into some other walled up space without getting any real world experience or exposure. These early life experiences shape us and inform us and help us become an actualized version of who we might be. You may very well be right that what you have is an endgame goal and that you're both lucky enough to have stumbled upon it first thing... But she has no way of really knowing that. You would have to trust her to go out into the world and to return to you when she's ready. I have a friend like this who got married pretty young and only had a first love and in our 30s she started getting very depressed because she has no life skills or experience she wasn't even ever in a position to work outside of the home and any attempt she made to explain to her husband that she wanted to go out and experience the world was met with a lot of control on his end. He died a few months ago and she's pretty much left with a complete blank slate in terms of skill sets work experience and general knowledge and she has a pretty deep issue with social anxiety because she feels kind of ashamed and like she's dumb or stupid. The sad thing is she's free to do all of the things that she wanted to do but she didn't want to lose her husband to have to earn that allowance. And why did her husband control her anyway? because he was more or less afraid that she would go out of the world and find herself and she wouldn't be anything like the woman he married or perhaps wouldn't want to be with him anymore.

1o88eun,njuzi8k,"I spent my twenties traveling and I can tell you that it does get harder as you get older. First, youre less likely to have a shared experience as most of your friends will be more settled and the people you meet will be more likely to be young. Second, even for the most flexible, die hard travelers I know, our relationship with discomfort changes. At 23 I didnt care what POS bed in what massive dorm I slept in as long as there was a bar in the hostel and it was packed with cute Australians. These days, I want to sleep well, and even if its in a shared space I dont want to be surrounded by drunk college kids. Comfort comes at a cost. Third, for many admittedly not all of us, were more risk averse as we get older and misery feels less adventuresome and more like just plain misery. I had typhoid in India and my younger self was slightly thrilled by it. Now? Hell no. Id also never do half the things I did when I was younger, they seem like stupid risks heres to you bridge jumping but Im glad I had that phase. Finally, time away is different now.

There's a ton of trial and error just to learn and relearn who you are in ANY relationship -- with parents and siblings and family, with colleagues, with friends, and so on. You change with the culture. You change with world events -- look at how the pandemic affected and blew up many relationships. Telling yourself you're committing forever to one person without really road testing yourself IN THE WORLD is dangerous. Also, many relationships run their course, which is an important lesson to learn in early life when you're gripping on tight to everything. It can feel easy at 23 to say I'm formed, I know everything about self and what I want, but the exploration is precisely the way to test that hypothesis. If I had married anyone I desperately wanted at 23 I'd be divorced by now based on what I know now about us both. The self is enormous, evolving, and 95 of it remains submerged in the unconscious. 23 is like the rough draft of the rough draft.

1o88eun,njtfk1v,"Its clear you are hurt by your ex-girlfriends choice. Rather than looking for a debate it may be best to head over to rrelationshipadvice. Great page for advice on break ups. This is a personal decision with no objective correct standard or rationale. This is not subject that is capable of objective debate or objective truths. Your exs position is valid and shared by the majority of people your age and the VAST majority of people over 35. It isnt a coincidence that this advice is so common, it is because life experience will teach you that it is the correct POV. My reason why exploration in early to mid 20s is key is two fold. First, most people have not figured out who they are until they are in their late 20s, at least. I was well spoken, getting ready to go to law school, and a very capable debater in my early 20s. I would have staunchly written here that I knew exactly who I was. And, I would have genuinely believed that at the time. But, I was wrong. It really was not until a few serious relationships in my mid-late 20s not working out that I learned who I was and, most importantly, what I was looking for in a life partner. I valued the wrong things in my early 20s and I had immature relationship tendencies that are common of many men at that age. For example, did you try to convince your ex with the same rationale you wrote here? If so, i would say that was an immature response. Second, which is particularly applicable to someone like you that spent 18-22 in a relationship, is that you are not yet capable or comfortable being alone. If you are not comfortable just being alone, then you will not be prepared to do the hard work of waiting for the right relationship. You should be looking for the right thing in the next few years not just the next thing. It was not until I was 27 that I realized I had filled all of the voids with meaningless relationships and that I was truly afraid of being alone. My 16-20 Year old relationship was one of pure comfort. We were familiar with each other and we got along so well stayed together. I spent 6 months without dating at all. No apps, no hook ups, just me. I took some trips alone, read more books, focused on my career more. I realized that I was okay alone and a partner was someone that could supplement my already incredible life and my happiness did not depend on the presence of another person. A few months after re entering the dating scene, I met my wife. Maybe you will meet your wife next month, I dont know. My advice to you would be to accept that you may not know it all and maybe, just maybe, the majority of people giving you identical advice have learned a thing or two in life that you have yet to experience. Book a trip with some friends, go back packing for a few weeks, hiking, go to Europe and stay in a hostels. Focus on yourself and what makes you happy. You seem to have a strong moral compass.

And it is less like that today than it has ever been in the history of any nation in the English speaking internet using world. The difference is that today women have far more ability to speak up when a guy does something that pisses them off. Which is a massive advance in the quality of our society. Like, do you really think that so many more women in the past actually liked all the cringe-y chivalrous BS men used to do and for which they expected to be showered with praise? Or do you think that maybe a lot of them just put up with it because they weren't allowed to live independently, so either they put up with the least gross dude they could find within a certain time span or they ended up on the street? The women who lived back then worked pretty hard to change a lot of these attitudes and build power for themselves and their descendants. Do you really think they would have done that if they were perfectly fine with the way they were being treated? Now, I think I can understand and sympathize with the root cause of the issue you're talking about -- that is, society does a very poor job of teaching social skills to men, and while some men are able to figure it out on their own there are many men who are never taught and don't know how to learn what they need to learn in order to get what they expect to get in the world. That is indeed a thing, and it sucks. And us dudes need to do a better job taking care of and helping each other, the way women have taken care of and helped each other in the course of feminism. But there is no acceptable outcome to this that allows men to continue to be socially inept and often kind of gross while simply forcing women to endure that even when they don't want to. It is good that women have the ability to say no to dudes they don't like. And if a guy regularly gets told he is being threatening when he tries to flirt, I guarantee that is a matter of him not knowing how to behave, not something wrong with society.

Sometimes they'll do it even after I've already said it's a hard boundary and I'm absolutely against being choked. A guy not feeling comfortable going to his favorite coffee shop because he gave the barista his number and she found it uncomfortable isn't at high risk. He's mildly inconvenienced. The social stigma also isn't as severe as you speak of. Here's a true example, a friend of mine, who I'm still friends with despite this, asked me out multiple times when we first met. He would not stop begging to go out and also made uncomfortable sexual advances including sharing a dick pic. I had to shut him down hard and I definitely did tell people he made me uncomfortable. Other people had concerns too, including someone in a fucked up situation that he offered to stay with him and her feeling pressured to repay him with sex, something he explicitly requested.

He didn't get exiled and he was still able to hit on women, sometimes even in uncomfortable ways. People definitely did talk about his creepy behavior, another man talked to him about taking no for an answer the first time, but no one labeled him as a predator because it's clear he wasn't outright trying to rape people, just really desperate and being super uncomfortable. He grew from it, and aside from the person who lived with him who does not have a friendship with him anymore, he is still accepted in the community. He even told me about getting together with another woman who goes there. So he clearly was not completely shut down and unable to make any romanticsexual connections. This sort of ending is often the outcome of men's creepy behavior being spoken about in communities. Some women will avoid him, some men might speak up with advice for him to be less demanding once rejected, and overall mostly the community goes on how it did, including him. Most communities won't exile someone or get deeply involved unless severe violence is present. And even then, sexual violence is often downplayed rather than punishing a violator. On the flip end let's talk about the severe risks to women while dating. If she doesn't know him well there's a risk he will harm her and no one will take it seriously because she put herself in that situation. If she refuses to meet alone, or has a high bar for her safety, she's called a prude or a bitch. If she is raped, it's more likely it won't be reported and the rapists life won't even be impacted. Only 31 of rapes are reported according to the department of justice. I haven't had a year of my life I haven't been followed, cat called, violently harassed or someone attempted to coerce me into sex I didn't want to have. A man choked my ex gf at a college party because he figured she wanted it because she was drunk. This is a lesbian who repeatedly denied his advances and ya know what the school did? Nothing. Ya know what repercussions he faced? Absolutely nothing. And let me remind you that even consensual choking has a high risk level for stoke and brain damage. At least 1 in 3 women have experienced rape. How many men have been completely shattered by false accusations, which legally only happened less than 1 of the time? It is disingenuous to call a man not being able to get coffee from a favorite spot high risk. Especially disingenuous because his exile is likely self imposed and not a business actually refusing him service, as most service industry's policy around sexual violence is that it requires active touching and a violation that is reported to the police. Straight up violent verbal sexual harassment is dismissed more often than not in kitchens. Harassment is experienced by over 90 of women working in restaurants. Here's a source with more information To compare men's high risk situation of being called creepy in dating to womens high risk of violence shows that it is absolutely tone deaf and ridiculous to call mens experience with dating high risk. It absolutely pales in comparison to women's risks in dating which includes actual high levels of risk of violence, coercion and rape. It also is not as dramatic or life changing to be labeled a creep as you assert. Most men called creeps are not impacted at all by it, and the ones that are usually just get less opportunities to hit on women. Very few men are losing all their friends, their job or their home over asking someone out. Even the very few who are falsely accused less than 1 are not going to face serious loss in these departments. There is little to no threat to their livelihoods or life itself. It is not high risk. The same cannot be said of women, who do risk their life to date, and who all take precautions explicitly because any harm that comes to them will likely be blamed on them by society. It is wrong to call these experiences high risk for men. By comparison to women's experiences dating, these risks of being seen as creepy are barely life impacting.",163,1760390797.0
1o5uxod,njcabtu,"Flirting, courting, engagement, and marriage have ALWAYS been entangled with the language of power. Yes, the risk of the initiator being checked on their attempt to assert power has increased. This is because we are more aware of that power and how it has been historically gendered, physically and socially more dangerous for women, and we have increased our education, research, and communication about the problems inherent in pas assumptionsnorms. It used to be the norm to transgress womens boundaries even resenting that they may exist in an effort to gain sexual access. Trapping women against walls, stalking, and even physical abuse were portrayed as sexy or romantic. Men and fewer women would skip the consent stage and spy on women, trick them, bully them, or otherwise try to expedite the courting process. In many societies, consent was explicitly denied women and some men. Prom night pressure, virginity narratives for both women and men, and endless media all undermined consent for all parties involved. Now there is not a human being in the developed world who can claim they have never heard how bad these things are. Feminism, social science, various faiths, laws, and norms have all improved our understanding of the value of consent. My hope is that by moving the consent requirement all the way to the first interactions and empowering people to set boundaries, the crippling fear of and often violent response to imposed on men of rejection that makes us so brittle and dangerous will lessen too. Strength is acknowledging boundaries, not feeling entitled, and requiring enthusiastic consent. If you cant get that, and you persist, you are the problem.",40,1760389861.0
1o5uxod,njd54m8,"Im a man, I used to feel this way, however I changed my mind. I often walk alone at night and have walked alone at night in areas that are sketchy. Women dont really do that in America because theyre legitimately worried about their safety. Ive never shared my location data with friends before going on a date. Women do that very frequently because theyre legitimately worried that a man could try to do a lot of vile stuff to them, or that they might not be able to leave if its going badly. I dont know many men who are worried about being roofied by a woman, and I dont know any men who have been roofied by a woman. These are legitimate worries women have. Im a man, Ive never had these worries. My physical safety has never been in question When I started going on dates with my current partner she told me that she had bad experiences with somebody in the past. To help her feel comfortable I went slowly, I made sure that we always went places that were public, I made sure to gauge how she was feeling and if she was comfortable with stuff. It was really helpful. Ive experienced bad shit from partners, but I didnt have that same fear that women had. Im sorry but I dont think that being worried about somebody mistaking my intentions is the same thing.

1o5uxod,njc9weq,"Yeah idk, rejecting romantic advances from men still carries real physical risks for women and girls which men are generally not subject to at least, not men who are exclusively attracted to women, which imo still weights the risks of flirting and dating much more toward women. However, yeah, times have changed, and men are far more likely to be accused of creepy behavior and experience social consequences for that, and sometimes this includes men who genuinely have no creepy intentions. Sometimes innocent men are harmed, and that sucks, but holding men to higher standards and employing whisper networks against men who are disrespectful and creepy are both part of the reason why modern dating has become safer for women.",37,1760389728.0

When a woman is found dead, the first type of person the police look for, is a husband, boyfriend, someone she dated, etc. Men are the perpetrators in the vast majority of murders of women, accounting for approximately 89 of female homicides committed by a male they knew.

1o5uxod,njdld9k,"The problem you discuss re the language of power imbalance and coercion, while real and existing, I think is overstated. I think it's more of a niche issue that is both overrepresented in digital media as compared with how dating and flirting happens in real life and also concerns a moral panic the worst of which we have already seen come and go. I think 5-10 years ago that was a bigger problem than it is today. I would argue that the bigger issue is the lack of social integration among people of dating age. People socialize online instead of in real life. People have fewer friends. And this had many impacts. One is that young people are more socially awkward and anxious than any generation preceding them, which genuinely does make dating and flirting or being flirted with more risky and uncomfortable than it once was. Another is that people are less often members of mixed-gender social groups of people of a similar age. This does more than merely open people up to more potential partners to whom one already has some sort of a connection, and can thereby be a safer environment within which to explore dating because let's be real hitting on your friends can still be awkward and uncomfortable. It also means that there are today fewer instances of being connected to potential partners through the friend of a friend route. Because in situations that arise from these social contexts, dating and flirting carry drastically different riskreward profiles. For a woman, even a tangential familiarity with a young man, some awareness of his reputation, and the knowledge that he is incentivized to maintain a certain reputation of conduct can go a long way in establishing a degree of security wrt to prospect of dating. And conversely, for young men, good standing within a context of preexisting social ties and mutual connections can help ensure a level of good faith insofar as he is concerned about his words or actions being poorly received. Long story short I think you drastically underemphasize what I would argue is the chief cause of the problem you cite. In addition to being legitimately worse at flirting, signaling and dating through no fault of their own young people are extremely isolated and atomized. Cold approaches genuinely are becoming more of the past because people are walking around with their faces in their phones, earbuds in their ears, and deeply uncomfortable in real-time face-to-face interaction with strangers. But there's also the issue surrounding the fact that the social scripts we have inherited around dating assume a social infrastructure that no longer exists. Nowadays, when a man approaches a woman, they are each in a tangible sense much more on islands than in a previous world wherein there was an integrated social fabric in which they were both embedded. And this changes everything. You'll be more smooth and thereby less threatening in an environment like that because it will have happened tons of times. For reasons of maintaining their own reputations, women will be incentivized to be thoughtful and compassionate in their rejections. Dates won't be all or nothing. Maybe it doesn't work out but maybe through word of mouth you've made yourself available to or more attractive to other potential partners. Aside from the above, there's also the inundation of horrific online content telling men and women to hate each other. Can't go without mentioning that. It may seem as though I've neglected to address the gender imbalance surrounding this. I'd say that this element mainly stems from two sources. One of them being the traditional expectation that men initiate, which, though it carries certain privileges, is for reasons discussed above arguably more of a burden than it ever has been before. The other being the fact that, for whatever reasons, men do seem to be less socially oriented and prone to isolation than women, which would cause this to hit them especially hard. Anyway, I believe that certain structural forces and their impact on our social life are far more significant than the discourse you've described. I would say that discourse is relatively niche and is already falling out of fashion to a noticeable degree.",5,1760406094.0

Those are all signs of a no romance zone. If the shop is not crowded meaning she doesn't have a lot of work to worry about, she doesn't look tired, she is not just polite or curt with you and actually responds to small talk with more than a few words, congrats! You may shoot your shot. But. Do not expect her to accept. Because women also just want friends. And most importantly if you get angry after a rejection, you are the problem. If you refuse to even try to read the room, you are the problem. Otherwise, all modern society did was start to protect women more. Which isn't a bad thing.

I know that's not very relevant to your point, but it shows that we are very recently stepping out of a world that was very very unsafe for women.

And maybe it is... But quite frankly, women need time to believe that men are willing to be told No. Enough people in this world have had a nice guy take it way too far actually a disgustingly high percentage of women. Now it's definitely not ok to generalize men. I'm not saying since enough people have been raped by men, men are all bad and need to be watched closely. That's why I brought up the marital rape laws. There are women alive today, who aren't even old people who have been legally raped. And vice versa... Society doesn't change on a dime like that. Women can't just simply be expected to accept that since it's finally socially unacceptable to physically harass them in public, now we can all let our guard down.

Does anybody remember the articles that came out immediately after Sinners crushed week 1? Oh I remember, they're writing them for the studios that are trying to claw back power after PTA, Coogler, Creggers and others have killed this year as Directors have asked for more autonomy. This article is straight up bullshit. They're using the term projecting as if it's done making money. They're also claiming that WB 2025 slate doesn't offset the losses of a movie in it's 3rd week of release, when Warner has done 4B at the box office this year. That's a B... do they not know the difference between a billion and a million? Using their same logic regarding OBAA's ticket sales, that would mean 2B in ticket revenue... Tell me with a straight face that WB isn't absolutely ecstatic with the business OBAA has done. There are zero movies I can think of in the last 3 years that have gotten the across the board adoration this has. Not Oppenheimer, not Dune. You probably have to go all the way back to Parasite.

I wanted a bigger mystery. But once its established immediately that the premise is ACTUALLY different from what the trailers were presenting, I kinda just kept waiting for the big moment, the deep dark reveal, and instead we got a weird dream sequence with the floating rifle and then the whole entire mystery is revealed via flashback and its just too obvious and boring for me that oh. the kid that didnt get kidnapped, maybe he actually had more to do with it! that was just unrealistic to me. yes, the movie is so well made and executed well visually overall. !I would have just changed the story and fully commit to the ALL children from a single class go missing!

1o6chaz,njig7s3,"Shoot, it's been a month already? Fck. Then let me get this off my chest. My problem with Borderlands games and really, with all loot-driven games is that once I'm to the point where most of my gear is great - meaning I've won the RNG lottery enough times that I'm basically just wearing one big amalgamated jackpot - the odds of finding new gear worth equipping goes 0.1, and the fun-factor plateaus insufferably. My power fantasy becomes a power reality, and whatever build I've got going by then all but stops evolving, and instead progress just becomes about incremental refinement and occasional adaptation to in-game stressors. And I'm not talking about trying to make high-level end-game builds. I'm talking about like what usually happens right around level 30-40 in most games. From this point, try as I might to get my money's worth, my interest can last only so many gameplay loops. I eventually, inexorably, realize my build is no longer cutting it, fighting is becoming truly tedious, and now instead of feeling giddy to find loot for loot's sake, and instead of getting to experiment with a bunch of wildly different but basically equivalent equippables, I'm just mindlessly clawing open chest after chest after chest, popping hordes of bubble-wrap-like enemies, numb to everything that is supposed to be fun while I hope - with steadily depleting reserves of immersible energy - to win yet another lottery just so I can find whatever it is I need to get back to being able to enjoy the game again. Even when I do, though, if I do, it's usually too little late for me. The honeymoon has ended, I'm completely out of love with the core gameplay loop, and more likely than not I've already begun cheating on the game with some other sexier, more hand-crafted, less repetitive game. It's why I can never seem to make it past like 50 of the campaign on my first try, and why I much prefer to just start multiple new games with each of the different character classes, and get the ones I like best to their plateau-points. Seeing any single character through to their end-game builds just ... isn't worth the like 80-20 ratio of brainless repetition to genuine pleasure for me. EDIT Paragraph breaks.",4,1760474854.0

This is the natural evolution of dehumanizing rhetoric and humor that spun out of the old Stormfront forums for more than 20 years, then circulated in various chan communities as ironic humor turned much more serious with time. Only now the kids that grew up reading it were accepted into the mainstream GOP thanks to Trumpism, and this is the result. Trump's original MAGA movement as stoked by Bannon when aimed at young men was filled with this stuff, at first seemingly on the fringes, but always hidden in its core. Recruiting young men through extremist rhetoric has always been a centerpiece of the Trump GOP, even if it wasn't initially their strongest base of support.

1o6lppi,njhn1fa,"This is the culmination that Republicans have been working towards. As we've seen, there has been a great effort put in to softening the Nazi brand in the last decade. Between politicians openly quoting Hitler, Musk very openly pushing Nazi themes and rhetoric to the point where he busted out the Nazi salute a few times at a Republican convention to the applause of the crowd and downplaying or denying the Holocaust, Joe Rogan defending Musk, and our current administration borrowing Nazi tactics, there has been this and more done in order to have people think gee, if the guy I voted for and the guys I subscribe to believe this, maybe Hitler wasn't that bad after all. If you want to change history, best way is to change peoples' perception of it. It's easy for Republicans to deny actual historical events and downplay horrific historical events they practice this every day when they ignore the countless lies they are told in order to toe the party line. Change what people think about history, then sell them the idea that all of the horrors that happened in the past not only didn't happen, but it is something that they should want for their own future. It's the same reason why actual historians and people with two brain cells to rub together have been listening to Trump's rhetoric reading the things he has been posting the last decade, and been warning anyone who would listen that we were heading towards authoritarianism. And, here it is. This is no longer we're heading toward the cliff, we're going down it now, to the delight of a shockingly large percentage of the country.",22,1760466129.0

The Kimmel comment is the perfect example because he said nothing even approaching a celebration of Kirk's death or even a criticism of Kirk. The supposedly offensive comment only criticized Trump and MAGA, yet the MSM didn't push back on that at all.

My grandpas birthday was a couple weeks ago. 6 weeks before his birthday, I texted all of my siblings and cousins theres 9 of us and told them to send me a picture of themselves within the next 4 weeks so I could put it on a phone case for our grandpas birthday. 2 weeks later I sent the text again, saying I needed a picture of them and anybody that chooses not to send a picture will be replaced by a picture of my dog. I had 3 cousins tell me to screenshot something from their instagrams. I didnt respond. I sent a text out the day before I put in the order saying anybody that did not send a picture of themselves in the next 24 hours would be replaced by pictures of my dog. The same 3 cousins never sent pictures. Their spots have my dog in a sombrero, my dog at the pumpkin patch, and my dog in a chicken costume. They came over for my grandpas birthday and saw him open his new phone case. They saw that their pictures werent on the case and got mad at me for not picking something off their instagrams like they told me to.

I know it must be very hard for you and I'm sorry for your loss, but honestly, a few nights of peanut butter sandwiches for dinner would be better than having the stress on both of you of having to deal with this. Sounds like you need space and boundaries. It is absolutely NOT okay for her to take out her frustrations on you like this, nor scream at him like that. Some things that helped me with my son are 1. Make your home your safe place. Limit who comes in and how often they stay. Let him know that home is his sanctuary where he can be safe and be himself not mask. Within home, let him know his room if he has his own is HIS space and if he needs time to himself, you will respect that and let him go hang out there if he is feeling overwhelmed or needs time out to recharge. If people visit, they don't get to go into his space. There is no reason for them to be in there and they can interact with him in the family areas. His space is his own, though obviously, while you can be respectful of his space, he needs to accept that you will need to enter it but you won't moverearrange his stuff without talking to him first, etc. 2. If you are going out, especially somewhere difficult for your son, limit the time you spend there. Try to give clear guidelines for how long you are going to stay, but be prepared to leave earlier if need be. If visiting, prepare to intercept and draw attention away from your child if he is becoming overwhelmed. Give him things he can distract himself with fidget toys, books, games, etc and give him time away, if possible e.g. he can sit in the car for a few minutes, maybe under the guise of fetching something for you, just to give him a break away and try to end these interactions with something positive to him. E.g. you've done really well. If you want to, when you get home, you can have time to do X activity that you really like.. When my son was younger, that may be watching TV or playing video games, but now it tends to be more you have X time to disappear to your room and not be called on or disturbed e.g. with my son, it might be You survived a whole morning visiting family, you can now disappear for the rest of the afternoon, but after 5pm, I need you to come help out with your normal chores like emptying the dishwasher etc. Once my son knew that he had a safe place, I would limit time spent in overwhelming places, and not leave him alone with people who overwhelmed him, he calmed down a lot. He was better able to communicate not always verbally, but in whatever way he felt comfortable with at the time when he was struggling and it massively helped him learn emotional regulation. Also, foreshadow everything as best you can. NO SURPRISES. EVER. My son is in college now, and he still absolutely freaks out if I spring things on him. Even things I know he is going to be resistant to and struggle with coping are much better when he knows about them in advance. Yes, he can stress leading up to these events, but it is a far lesser evil than being unprepared and overwhelmed by the unexpected. Good luck!",49,1760528615.0

She refuses to work because she doesnt want to and I can't have the state pay her for babysitting cause she has no certifications and she doesnt have a high school diploma or GD. My son is in school and has a para because he is flight risk not because he violent, though we've had some violent outbursts after his father passed away but he doesnt know how to properly process this loss and most kids dont so I dont know why everyone acts like he should get over it. He struggled with voilent tendencies when he was small hut he has been in the need therapys since he was 4.

Strategies that have helped me with family members who are like this 1. Dont argue facts, reflect feelings. You might say I can tell youre feeling really overwhelmed and unappreciated right now. 2. Set firm but simple boundaries. I understand if you cant babysit right now. I need calm care for the kids, so Ill make other arrangements. 3. Dont seek nurturing where it cant be given. She isnt capable of seeing where you are struggling when she is struggling. 4. Use I statements they are less triggering. Acknowledge her sacrifice, even if you dont agree with her. Validate her feelings without taking blame I hear that this feels really overwhelming for you. I dont want you to feel unappreciated. Im grateful for the times youve stepped in. If you want her to continue babysitting, youre going have to extend the olive branch first. Mom, I know the other day was hard for both of us. I dont want things to be tense between us, because I really appreciate the way youve helped with the kids. I also need to keep things calmer for childs name when hes upset. Can we find a way to make it easier next time? Maybe if I set snacks aside here, you wont have to worry about food, and Ill keep him ready so transitions go smoother.

1o9085r,njyqjg6,"NTA. You can park there if you have the permit, which you do. There is no rule that says you have to immediately leave once you get in the car.

It is perfectly reasonable to take a few minutes sitting in a spot. And legal. You did absolutely nothing wrong. Don't let someone who has issues get to you. I think she likely walked off mid-sentence because she saw the placard and realized she made a huge mistake and looked like an AH and couldn't deal with that blow to her ego.",6,1760712500.0

1o9085r,njyt918,NTA. It's not your problem that woman's car was too big for her to handle properly. Maybe she should look into getting a smaller car instead of blaming other people for her faults.,27,1760706672.0
1o9085r,njz34ot,"NTA if you were just taking a few minutes to catch your breath, check messages, etc. Safer to do that parked than driving. Everyone here is assuming bc the other person said 15 minutes doesn't mean that was the actual time frame. Now if you did sit there for 15 minutes playing on your phone then that's rude, especially bc it sounded like there was only 1 other marked handicap space. Close or not but sometimes theres a reason why someone needs a different spot, maybe for ramp access or just easier maneuverability. All that being said, I am someone who has handicap parking but from outward appearances doesn't need it. Its no one's business why you need it or when you use it.

1o9085r,njzd8ps,NTA People see younger people in general in a handicapped spot and think they dont need it. I got looks when I was driving my mom around who has a temporary handicapped permit due to surgery and parked in a spot. They stopped as soon as I got her mobility device out.,6,1760713019.0
1o9085r,njytgp7,"NTA and none of her business at all. People never expect the blue badge when I whip it out and I don't always use it, I feel too self conscious most of the time, but the only times that anyone has ever said anything negative it's been from a 'busy body' position, rather than 'I need disabled parking'.

She should have kept her mouth shut and used another spot. She is not your doctor, and she is not a cop on duty with a ticket book, so it is none of her business.",4,1760715287.0
