This is a Rust rewrite of the established Python tool pre-commit which is widely used. Pre-commit is a great tool but it suffers from several limitations 1. Its pretty slow although its surprisingly fast for being written in Python 2. The maintainer asottile made it very clear that he is not willing to introduce monorepo support or any other advanced features e.g. parallelization asked over the years I was following this project from its inception whats now called Prek and it evolved both very fast and very well. I am now using it across multiple project, e.g. in Kreuzberg both locally and in CI and it does bring in an at least x10 speed improvement linting and autoupdate commands!

1o9gyxa,python,Rant Python imports are convoluted and easy to get wrong,"Inspired by the famous module 'matplotlib' has no attribute 'pyplot' error, but let's consider another example numpy. This works from numpy import ma, ndindex, typing ma.getmask ndindex.ndincr typing.NDArray But this doesn't import numpy numpy.ma.getmask numpy.ndindex.ndincr numpy.typing.NDArray AttributeError And this doesn't import numpy.ma, numpy.typing numpy.ma.getmask numpy.typing.NDArray import numpy.ndindex ModuleNotFoundError And this doesn't either from numpy.ma import getmask from numpy.typing import NDArray from numpy.ndindex import ndincr ModuleNotFoundError There are explanations behind this numpy.ndindex is not a module, numpy.typing has never been imported so the attribute doesn't exist yet, numpy.ma is a module and has been imported by numpy's init.py so everything works, but they don't convince me. I see no reason why import A.B should only work when B is a module. And I see no reason why using a not-yet-imported submodule shouldn't just import it implicitly, clearly you were going to import it anyway. All those subtle inconsistencies where you can't be sure whether something works until you try are annoying. Rant over. Edit as some users have noted, the AttributeError is gone in modern numpy 2.x and later. To achieve that, the numpy devs implemented lazy loading of modules themselves.

Is the learning curve or ecosystem a factor? Are there limitations in ASP.NET Core that make it less attractive for beginners or web startups? Is it just a regional or job market thing?

1o6wc5c,ChangeMyView,CMV Dems screwed up by going high when Trump first rose to power,"NOTE TO MODERATORS This is a repost from last night, when it got taken down for repeating recently-discussed topics. I appealed and got the OK to repost it. So, I know that title might sound a little confusing, but hear me out when Trump was nominated for president the first time in 2016, there was this attitude from the Democratic Party that when they go low, we go high. Michelle Obama even said this verbatim Basically, the idea was that Trump's a massive asshole, which is true, so let's be moral and righteous in the face of that. Well, I think it's been shown why that strategy was a complete disaster. Look, I'm not saying that Dems shouldn't be moral in the sense that they should abandon what I view as moral policies although many of them don't even currently rise to what I would consider to be that level, but that's a story for another day. This is more a personality thing, and how they fight for their agenda. During Trump's first term, Dems were all about redistricting reform, and many states passed independent redistricting commissions to fight gerrymandering, which House Dems at the national level also passed. But now that the GOP is doing mid-decade redistricting in several states, Dems realize that taking the high road in this instance was a losing strategy, and now they're left with no choice but to abandon that principle, at least for now, just to level the playing field. Actually, it's not even to do that, but rather just to make it slightly less disproportionately favorable to the GOP, which it is now in part because of Dems taking the high road. More recently, and this is what motivated me to want to make this post, there's been a scandal in the Virginia Attorney General's race, where the Dem nominee was caught privately wishing death upon a GOP colleague and his children Now, I'm absolutely not going to defend these comments or the fact that he was stupid enough to text this to a Republican, who would obviously want to use it against him at some point, but I will say that it's pretty interesting how that seemed to get far more attention than the GOP nominee for Lieutenant Governor getting caught liking Nazi porn I'm not trying to imply that one of these scandals is worse than the other, that's up to you to decide for yourself, but rather that this further illustrates my point people expect modern-day Republican politicians to be assholes, because - love them or hate them - that's the brand they've created for themselves, so they largely get a pass for it. Democratic politicians, meanwhile, have acted like they have the moral high ground for so long, and that's why they tend to suffer more when engulfed in scandal. My main point is that Democratic politicians saw Trump at first as a fluke, and thought they could simply rise above him on a moralpersonal level to win support from the public. That may have worked during his first term, but now, he's back and meaner literally and figuratively than ever, and they have way too much catching up to do with how far they fell behind in terms bringing equal yet opposite energy.",2478,534,1760487352.0,39,17.53846153846154,36.84607355057896,39,0,0.0
1o79x95,ChangeMyView,"CMV A continuous failure of left wing activism, is to assume everyone already agrees with their premises","I was watching the new movie 'One Battle After Another' the other day. Firstly, I think it's phenomenal, and if you haven't seen you should. Even if you disagree with its politics it's just a well performed, well directed, human story. Without any spoilers, it's very much focused on America's crackdown on illegal immigration, and the activism against this. It highlighted something I believe is prevalent across a great deal of left leaning activism the assumption that everyone already agrees deportations are bad. Much like the protestors opposing ICE, or threatening right wing politicians and commentators. They seem to assume everyone universally agrees with their cause. Using this example, as shocking as the image is, of armed men bursting into a peaceful albeit illegal home and dragging residents away in the middle of the night. Even when I've seen vox pop interviews with residents, many seem to have mixed emotions. Angry at the violence and terror of it. But grateful that what are often criminal gangs are being removed. Rather than rally against ICE, it seems the left need to take a step back and address 1. Whether current levels of illegal mmigration are acceptable. 2. If they are not, what they would propose to reduce this. This can be transferred to almost any left wing protest I've seen. Climate activists seem to assume people are already on board with their doomsday scenarios. Pro life or pro gun control again seem to assume they are standing up for a majority. To be clear, my cmv has nothing to do with whether ICE's tactics are reasonable or not. It's to do with efficacy of activism. My argument is the left need to go back to the drawing board and spend more time convincing people there is an issue with these policies. Rather than assuming there is already universal condemnation, that's what will swing elections and change policy. CMV. Edit to be very clear my CMV is NOT about whether deportations are wrong or right. It is about whether activism is effective.",2172,2289,1760532126.0,38,50.36842105263158,117.52903808099413,38,0,0.0
1o8t3nc,ChangeMyView,CMV criminalizing employers who hire undocumented workers would drastically decrease illegal immigration,"Ill start off by saying that idgaf about people moving here illegally. I just cant be bothered to care. But Im very tired of the debate. You really want to stop illegal immigration? Make it a criminal offense to hire undocumented workers. Why are we spending so many resources jailing and deporting immigrants? Just make it worse for the employers and then theyll stop hiring undocumented immigrants and then people wont want to move here in the first place. One of the main reason people risk it all to come to the States is because they know theyll be able to send money back home with the salary they make in American dollars. If there isnt an incentive to come and stay illegally, people wont come here as much. Since it would implode several industries to do this all at once, give businesses ample time to prepare. Give them amnesty for the undocumented workers they already hire but make them prove their new hires are legalized to work. Edit Some of you are confusing something being illegal with it being criminalized. Just because there is a law against it doesnt make it a crime. Crime a criminal offense, punishable by jail and a criminal record.

1o5ihay,ChangeMyView,CMV Nearly all corporations in the US will be financially ruined if the US becomes a fascist state.,"The United States is built on two workforces. Cheap immigrant labor and highly technical educated labor. Cheap immigrant labor is used in every facet of labor intensive industries. All resource extraction, construction, agriculture, manufacturing, food processing, shipping, etc uses it extensively. These immigrants are being targeted for removal by the Trump administration. Without these bodies to do the work these sectors will not be able to function. Removing this cheap labor also increases the price floor of labor for these industries and all others as well. So even if the industries can fill the vacancies the price for labor will drastically reduce or even eliminate their profit margin and the impacts all industries. Highly technical educated labor produces advanced tech goods and services. Amazon, Facebook, tesla, spacex, Nvidia, Microsoft, Boeing, lockeed Martin, Raytheon, etc all depend heavily on an educated labor force. This labor force is educated in liberal education systems. By this I mean a system that at least attempts to teach critical thinking. This is not a trait that is taught under fascism. Educated labor force is also acquired by importing educated immigrants who will not be coming or let in to the US in the current numbers under facism. By eliminating the educated labor pool tech industries will not be able to function. The US is also a consumption based economy. Increasing the cost of goods consumed in the US by either reducing the labor force and increasing its cost through deportation reduces how much can be consumed. Increasing the cost by imposing tarrifs also reduces consumption. The reduced consumptions reduces profits. Much of the entertainment industry is very liberal either by the people producing it or the content of the media and by what the consumers want. Disney and others would have severely curtailed profits under facism. Blue statescities subsidies red statescounties to an alarming degree. I have never personally had to do precise technical work while being threatened be I doubt I would be very effective in my work. Sending in military and paramilitary personal into blue areas under facism is threatening every worker of every industry in those areas. Productivity will decrease leading to financial hardships for companies.

I didn't think it was important to clarify which party I am talking about because the vast majority of people will probably not be familiar with it anyways, but since the question has come up a ton, I am going to answer it The party in question is called AfD. The politician who said The AfD in general is against women's rights. is Bjrn Hcke. However, multiple members of the party are openly sexist and misogynistic and the party itself doesn't do anything about it. One of their members Andy Shngart sent a student a minor! messages saying he hoped she would get SAd. Andy Schngart was even found guilty by a court in this matter and the party did not distance itself from him but he even received a promotion.

1o88eun,ChangeMyView,"CMV The explore now that you're young, settle down later makes no sense","My girlfriend of four years recently ended our relationship because she's afraid of missing out on being young. We're 22 and 23 respectively. Her reasoning was straightforward, she has her whole life to settle down and have a family a house... but she won't be young forever. She feels like she needs to explore now or she'll regret it when she's 40. She says she loves me like she's never loved anybody and the relationship is perfect, but she's clearly contradictory about the matter. This is an incredibly common narrative, even a normal doubt amongst much more mature relationships. I think our culture reinforces this idea that you must prioritize exploration in your twenties or you'll somehow miss your chance. The thing is, that doesn't make much sense to me. When you actually break down the logic, it's completely backwards. Let me explain myself. There are essentially two paths people talk about, exploring and being single versus committing to build a life with someone. The cultural wisdom says you have limited time for the first and unlimited time for the second. Which is what she argues too. But I feel like reality is exactly the opposite. Exploring and being single has no real constraints. You don't need anyone else's cooperation. There's no biological clock. You can travel, meet new people, go to bars, have casual relationships at literally any age. Twenty-five, thirty, forty, it doesn't matter. The option is always there. It requires no external validation, no compatible partner, nothing. Just your own decision to do it. Of course responsibilities can play a part in it, but it's still much easier than the other side of the coin. Building a committed relationship and family, on the other hand, has very real time constraints. You need to find someone compatible, which isn't guaranteed at all in life and takes time. If you want children, there are fertility windows that narrow with age. It requires another person's commitment and timing to align with yours. You can't just decide at thirty-five that you're ready and make it happen. These things are outside your control. I'm not saying exploration is bad or that everyone should settle down young. I'm saying the timeline argument that's used to justify this choice is fundamentally flawed. It's postponing the thing with actual difficulty to prioritize what's available whenever one wants. The response I usually hear is but it's not the same to explore at thirty-five as at twenty-two. Fine, maybe the experience is different. But it's also not the same to try to start a family at thirty-five as at twenty-five, and in that case the difference is biological reality, not just vibes. I think this narrative we've created actually sets people up to struggle. We tell them to postpone the difficult, time-constrained thing to prioritize the easy, always-available thing. Then surprise! they have trouble with what they postponed. If anything long term relationships have been declining because now more than ever people don't work through rough patches.",1234,784,1760626668.0,40,82.65,271.1742567059049,40,0,0.0

The language around romance has become entangled with the language of power, framing nearly every interaction through the lens of imbalance or potential harm. This framing, while born from valid concerns about consent and safety, has also created an atmosphere of suspicion where nuance and intent are often lost. Digital communication amplifies this tension, messages are overanalyzed, intentions scrutinized. Many retreat into irony or detachment, but beneath it all lies a shared confusion everyone craves connection, yet few feel safe making the first move. A simple compliment, a moment of chemistry, or an attempt to connect in person can easily framed as inappropriate, not because it is, but because the cultural script now defaults to caution and moral judgment. As a result, any courtship outside, the controlled distance of dating apps, feels highly disincentivised.",969,2220,1760386651.0,36,90.83333333333333,184.73998243777962,36,0,0.0

So I 29M was at work during a pretty long meeting with a few other co-workers. One of my co-workers is new late 30s F and the conversation steered around our professional experiences and history. Pretty standard I guess. Midway during reviewing some boring stuff this co-worker asked me with a smirk, Can I ask you a question ? . Since we were talking about our professional lives I was like yeah sure whats up? , and she followed up with why do you always wear hats? Now, Ill be honest Im bald, however I like my baldness. I started balding at 21 and I was like, fuck that, and just shaved it off instead of trying to style my hair in anyway to hide it. Also since my hair is super curly and compact it just wasnt gonna be an option. In college people loved it, said I had a good head shape and said I looked like Terry Crews, Shaquille ONeal or The Rock not sure about that last one lol so I was pretty confident with it. But when I turned 25 I started being mistaken for 30 cause of the bald cut so I started wearing hats pretty much everywhere. Grew a collection for all situations, work, gym, social life. Anywhere besides weddings and funerals tbh. And with hats on at 29 Ive been mistaken to be as young as 22 not the goal but yeah. The plan was to wear them until 30 and then cut back when my head matched my age lol Anyways, this co-worker asks why do you wear hats everyday? to be fair its a corporate setting but its also tech, were in marketing and its 2025 so smart-casual is the rule of thumb and my bosses dont care and dress in hoodies and hats to work some days. I responded I like hats and she said but everyday? , so I said yeah Im bald, I like my headshape but I dont wanna look like Im 35 so Ill wear hats for now, plus I look good in them! . Now I wasnt thinking and shes probably around this 35 age or older so I may have offended her with that but she replied 29 and wearing hats everyday to hide? Wow This truck a nerve with me so I responded Well since joining Ive seen you wear makeup everyday, even casual Fridays or on your work from home team calls, so why do YOU wear makeup everyday? there was a muffled giggle but its clear the atmosphere was tense. She got heated and said thats a sexist question and I said How? Other women in the office dont wear makeup everyday and my boyfriend sometimes wears makeup when we go out to a high class event. He just doesnt do it everyday. So why do you wear makeup everyday? She got heated and silent and one of the other co-workers went back to focusing on the deck. I feel like her and I not on the best of terms now as she will not talk to me now. So, AITA for asking why my co-worker wears makeup everyday?",8337,2006,1760761111.0,39,790.9230769230769,2751.195175104583,39,0,0.0
1o770zv,AmItheAsshole,AITA for reminding my mom that my son is a child?,"My son was sick yesterday, and my mom offered to babysit for me since I couldn't miss work. For context, I30F am a single mom because my husband passed away in an accident last year. We had 2 kids together, ages 12 and 8, and my 8 years have severe ADHD and Autism. Being a newly single mom money has been really tight and I do get state assistance but not a lot and my husband didn't have life insurance so there was no money left to us from him.My mom and sister help me the with babysitting if the kids are sick or if there is no school cause I can't afford a sitter. The issues came when I told her I didn't have food to spare right now cause I haven't been able to go shopping yet and to please bring her own food or be prepped to have to have to buy herself food cause the food I have in the house is strictly for the kids till I can get to the store this weekendWe were all super sick last weekend and I don't live in a town with a grocery store and the closest one is a 30 minute drive. She said it would be easier to take my son to her house then which i was okay with, but 8 year old hates going to her house. When she comes to get him, he has a meltdown because he doesn't want to go to her house. I ask if she can just stay, and I can find a way to get more food before the weekend. She said no and insisted he had to come with her, and that made it worse. Now my mom has not had great patience, but her and my sister are the only sitters I have right now cause they don't charge me much, just the gas to get here. Well she lost it and started yelling at me and him that she didn't have time for this and she had plans that day she canceled just to watch himshe didn't mention this to me when I asked. She also said I quote I wish we could trade lives and I could lay around and throw tantrums all day and you can go to work and just have everyone use you and take your money all the time. How much it must suck to be you and do whatever you want while i have to do nothing but take care of other people. I never borrow money from my mother but my sister and grandma live with her and they dont work so I know she is under a lot of stress and she takes it out on me a lotcalling me burden. Letting me know how much my tragic loss has effected her negatively. Calling me other names or yelling at me for things my sister or grandma do I didn't yell or argue. I simply covered his ears and looked at her and went, Mom, he is 8. She lost it and screamed, F you then, miss work and lose money I don't care, I am leaving, and then she left. Now she says she will not babysit for me again so I can know true struggle, which if she follows through means I have to miss a bunch of work or find a sitter I can trust that won't break my bank. So I am wondering should I have cut her a break knowing she is under so much pressure and I understand she is frustrated and needs to get it off her chest but I feel like verbal punching bag and I dont want my kids to have to deal with that as well. Aita? Update My mom is banned from my place of work, and I will no longer be speaking to her, my grandma, and will be limiting contact with my sister. I was sent home early due to my emotional state. They showed up before my lunch break and demanded to talk to me, and when my boss said no, my mom lost it and started screaming at her so loudly I could hear down the hall from my classroom. She sent another staff member to get me to try to defuse the situation but my mom only started screaming at me that I wasted her time and her gas because she was going to have to wait around all day for meI told her I go to lunch at 1215pm everyday and she showed at 1030am while calking me all sorts of names and cussing with every other word. I asked if we could go out side to talk and she said that she no longer wants to talk to me and that she just came because my sister asked to herI didn't know this my sister made it seem like it was mom's idea on the phone. One of my coworkers is going to be retiring a week before Thanksgiving and told me she will watch my kids during school breaks after she retires for the same price I paid my mom after everyone got see what my mother was like in person. She said she doesnt feel right having me keep her as a sitter after her behavior today and she understands how hard being a widow isShe lost her husband when her kids were 10 and 14 but I had no idea until today since she never shared much about her personal life. We ended up having to talk to the police on my mother because she was refusing to leave, and they came and escorted her off the property. After they left my sister called me to tell me my mom blocked me on everything and told her she no longer has 2 daughters just one and that my sister is forbidden from coming to see me or watching the kids while she lives with our mother. Luckily, she will be moving in with her fiance after he gets back from deployment. Thank you for all the advice I did apply online to social security but received an automated email response saying due to the federal shut down the local office is closed they will check my application as soon as someone returns to the office. Also, in case anyone wonders, my coworkers knew childcare was a struggle for me but didn't have any advice to help me with childcare because most of them dont have kids, pr their kids are already grown. But the lady who offered to help is one of my favorite coworkers and she has come over to help me make decorations for our classrooms at work so she knows my kids and they really seemed to like her whenever she came by to work on work things and I know she is fully certified and train to care for a special needs child as everyone at my place of employment is.",7428,658,1760523044.0,39,717.025641025641,3176.089713962345,39,0,0.0
1o8t39z,AmItheAsshole,AITA for letting my daughter stay with me and my wife after she found out that her mom lied to her,"My ex and I have a 12 year old daughter, Olivia, with autism level 2. My ex has primary custody and I have Olivia on Wednesdays and every other weekend. A few months ago my ex told me she was feeling a little burnt out so she wanted us to keep Olivia from Wednesday to Sunday so she could go on a trip with some friends. Olivia is very attached to her mom, so my ex told Olivia that it was a work trip and she had to go. Last week one of my exs friends was at the house with my ex and Olivia and their vacation somehow came up. Olivia figured out that the vacation was the work trip that her mom told her about and freaked out because her mom lied to her and her mom doesnt lie. She hid in her room for the rest of the day, then called me and asked me to come get her. Shes been with us ever since. Shes really upset about this. She cries all the time because she wants her mom but she doesnt know what else her mom lied about and she doesnt trust her. Apparently Olivias aide called my ex because shes been having a hard time in school so now my ex wife is demanding that I send Olivia home so they can get back to her routines and start working with her therapist to help her get over this but I told her Olivia will go back when shes ready. Now shes threatening to call the police andor take me back to court over custodial interference even though weve always had a very friendly co parenting relationship. My wife thinks we should send her back to avoid drama but I think it should be Olivias choice. AITA for refusing to send her back after she found out her mom lied to her?",7361,1358,1760679401.0,39,691.2051282051282,1599.5585798057264,39,0,0.0
1o5byxt,AmItheAsshole,AITA for refusing to get a second job?,"My husband and I both started our own businesses 20 years ago. They were moderately successful in that, we werent rich, but our financial needs have always been met up until the last 5 years. My husbands business is what most would consider a luxury service. When times are tough, people do without said service. My husband tried several things to keep his business afloat, including taking out some loans and made some bad investments that have left us in not the best financial state. At this point, it costs more to operate his business than he is profiting from it. The writing has been on the wall the past several months, and hes finally agreed its time to close the doors. Now, I totally understand that this is something that is upsetting to him. This business was his dream and you cant just let go of that mentally in a snap, especially not after 20 years. I have been very supportive and let him vent. I have encouraged him to go to therapy, though he has turned me down. I want to be as sensitive as possible. I wish my business were enough to keep us afloat until he was ready to figure out what he wanted to do next. Unfortunately, with all the bills we have, we cant afford for him to sit around and not do anything. Neither of us went to college, which does mean his options are limited. Going back to school isnt financially possible right now, nor does he want to do that. Hed have to have a boss, potentially work weekends and weird hours, all the things you get to avoid when you have your own business of 20 years. I get why this isnt appealing to him, but unfortunately, its what he has to do. My husband has really pushed back on getting a new job. Ive tried to be as sympathetic as possible, but again, we cant afford for him to sit home all day. Weve talked about it, several times. I show sympathy and empathy. I, again, tell him to seek therapy. It always ends in an argument where I am told I am being unreasonable. The other day, my sister-in-law his brothers wife came over to talk to me. She spoke to me as if I were 5 years old and said I needed to give him a break. She said that I cannot expect him to go back to having a boss after 20 years. She suggested that I get a second job. With the hours I work, Id never get to see my kids or husband at that point. I said Im not going to do that. If my business went under, of course Id go and get a different job, but it is unreasonable for everyone to expect me to work all these hours while my husband does nothing his help with the housework and the kids has dropped since he had to close the business, so I doubt me working would change that, so Id be working 7 days a week, plus all that. My sister-in-law just kept telling me that this is a sacrifice I should be making and that I am being unreasonable. Everyone else seems to agree, including my husband. I feel insane. Am I the asshole for not wanting to get a second job and expecting him to get one?",6137,598,1760335912.0,39,353.4102564102564,1509.9463688548292,39,0,0.0
1o5i8os,AmItheAsshole,AITA for causing a scene at my in-laws' anniversary dinner over my brother-in-law's racist comments?,"I female 30yrs and my husband male 32 yrs have been married for four years and have a son, soon turning one. We are really close with my husband's older brother, he is really cool and we love hanging out with him. However, I have never really gotten along with his younger brother let's call him Mark because, among many other reasons, he has a tendency of putting out racist, sexist or otherwise inappropriate comments. Dare to say, our values and morals simply don't align but over the years I have learnt to bite my tongue and ignore the comments and to act civil around him in family gatherings. Things have however changed since having a child, as I do not want him to be exposed to this kind of racist talk, especially from an uncle who should act as a role model to our son. I talked to my husband about this issue and asked him to have a discussion with Mark that we do not allow this kind of talk around our child, as we want to raise him to respect people with different ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations etc. My husband agreed and promised to talk to Mark about it, or at the very least, intervene if Mark does this ever again in the presence of our son. A few days ago we went over to my in-laws' house for their wedding anniversary dinner. Everyone was having a great time up until Mark had had a couple of glasses of wine and begun with his racist slurring yet again I'll spare you from the details, but let me tell you, it was bad!. I looked over to my husband, expecting him to do or say something but he did nothing, just sipped his wine in silence. I felt this sudden rage and couldn't hold it in any longer and angrily hissed at Mark something along the lines of Will you shut the f up if you have nothing smarter to say?!. The whole room went dead silent and you could cut the atmosphere with a knife, it was so awkward for everyone. We finished our meal quickly and went home as soon as we could, me still boiling inside from anger over the whole situation and how my husband didn't stand up to me against his brother. Yesterday my husband received an angry text from my mother-in-law, stating I had ruined their anniversary dinner my lashing out at Mark at the table like that. I understand her being upset since the dinner was to celebrate their marriage and the conflict ruined the mood for everyone and now there is this bid drama in the family over what happened. I agree that the timing was not great and that I could have rephrased myself in a more constructive way but at the same time, I could not take it anymore and felt I had to put a stop to it once and for all. So am I the asshole? P.S English is not my first language, so please forgive me if the grammar isn't always a 100.",3230,721,1760358271.0,40,341.375,1261.5112501975557,40,0,0.0
1o9085r,AmItheAsshole,"AITA for staying in a disabled spot, or was grandma overreacting?","Im 25M, disabled, and I have a valid disabled parking permit. I drive an older BMW, a nice one imo. After my physiotherapy, I walked back to my car, parked in a disabled parking spot. I got in and spent a few minutes on my phone before heading home. Just taking a short breath, i always do that after physio. The parking lot was nearly empty. Next to me were three regular open spots, and across from me there was another empty disabled spot with two free spaces beside it. And its a free parking area, by the way. Then a woman, somehere mid-60s, drives up. She stares at me for a few seconds, then parks her car half almost crisscross across the disabled spot opposite me. She gets out, walks straight up to my window, and says Why are you taking up a disabled spot? Youve been sitting here playing games for fifteen minutes, and I want to park here. Honestly, I was a bit surprised . So I said, Im allowed to park here. I was just doing something on my phone and was about to leave. Before I could even finish my sentence, she cuts me off You dont need to justify yourself. Yet she keeps going, telling me its rude of me to sit there and that I should move over because she cant park her car anywhere else, because its too long. She came iver a bit rude. I tried to stay polite, but I could feel the frustration creeping in. This kind of thing happens sometimes tho, someone sees a young guy in a car and immediately assumes hes abusing a disabled spot. No one sees why that blue card is there in the first place. Eventually, she walked away mid-sentence. And I was a bit confused. I wasnt blocking anyone, I had a valid permit, and I was planning to leave. So was I really being rude, or was she just frustrated? Edit i think i stood there for 5, maybe 6 minutes. No longer. As for my disability, i have Friedreich Ataxia. I currently walk with a walking stick, am a bit wobbly when standing, everything costs energy and my voice is a little disorted. It doesnt get any better. When i sit i look completely normal. Not for pity, just understanding.",3206,423,1760704886.0,40,204.3,868.7716673556981,40,0,0.0
