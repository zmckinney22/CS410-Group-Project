njo6yw7,"Coming from a full stack dev consultant, I would like to invite you to look at this from the perspective of the stake holder. They care about value. You need to ask yourself what is the real value you bring to the company other than coding that is not replaceable by AI. For example, do you have a good design sense? What about UX? Will the AI coded front end by a backend dev translates to higher conversion rates better user experience? What about front end performance? AI or backend engineers usually overlook these, but conversion rate is what stake holders cares about at the end of the day, and user experience is what keeps the user retention high.

njcg8uh,"Not a former republic, but Poland. There was nothing to buy, and if there was, you waited in a long line to get it. Just normal things, like sugar and butter. For some years we could only buy a defined number of goods, like 600 grams of meat per month. Or one pair of shoes per year. If you needed a fridge, or furniture, or sth like that but not a dishwasher, there were NO dishwashers there was a line in which people waited for weeks. Well, not actually waited all the time, but there was a list of names in a notebook and you had to check you name every day with a person who had the notebook and was keeping the line. You missed a day for any reason? You are OUT. Then you got news that the shop will actually have delivery of e.g. fridges. and the last several days you actually waited 2424 alternating with family members. And then you bought whatever was in the shop, the model, color, size did not matter. And things were super expensive, like TV cost an annual salary. And if you managed to go abroad you felt REALLY poor, as your monthly salary was equal to 30 USD. A salesperson in a shop was way more important than a university professor. But if you were e.g. a party-member boss of a car factory, you bought a new car every year, sold it on secondary market at triple the price which people paid in order not to wait a decade in a virtual line to buy a car from a factory and lived like a king.

njuvmwb,"Whether or not this changes your view, I want to share something that I wish I understood an internalized much earlier in life. You're changing monthly if not weekly or daily when you're young and still figuring out life. That's observably true in settings like high school and college. What people won't tell you is that it continues into your twenties thirties forties fifties, you're changing until the day you die, constantly becoming the person who you will be next. It feels like we're simultaneously sold two lies 1. People don't really change 2. That we can Settle down when we finally realize who we are and what we want. You hear a lot of 1 from people getting out of fractured relationships. What they are really saying is I wanted this person to be somebody else, and they weren't willing to be that. It could be as simple as more organized or less of a slob. It's so obvious to you, why don't they see how they could just do better and it would make life easier for them and you! But the truth is people are constantly changing, which ties into 2, and your cmv. They're just changing because they want to, there's an intrinsic motivation, not an extrinsic penalty. One of the reasons why really good couples divorce between year 5 and 12 is that despite having children, buying a house, planning a future, having so much shared life together, what's also happening is you have two adults who are still changing, and those newly drifted-apart humans are no longer aligned enough to stay partners. They were both changing, but they weren't in tune with each other's changes. They'll see all the bad changes in their partner, and perhaps point to the good changes they've made. Scumbag human brain, this is an evolutionary adaptation. For your girlfriend, it sounds like she's on the front end of this. She's worried she'll miss out on experiences because she's tied down. There are also a lot of women who experience this in their early forties after starting families and feeling like they are stuck. Men tend to experience this too as a midlife crisis, but they're less likely to look at the marriage as an anchor. It's a human condition, that feeling never truly leaves us. So the reason your view is worth updating is the same reason the inverse is also wrong, or at least incomplete. The only way our relationship survives, at any age, at any stage, is if you have two people changing in harmony. They you have to continue to be curious and patient with who the other person is becoming. And it's not even themselves former you, insofar as the person who met their changing partner 4 years ago, it's the new person you've become being in tune with the new person they've become. The best way to visualize this is four distinct people in stages of metamorphosis. And that repeats in perpetuity. If the grass doesn't get watered, it does start to look greener elsewhere. But it's never the same grass as what was planted. And it's difficult to not internalize it, but often times break-ups are natural bbecause of this constant evolution. I really wish this weren't the case after marriage, because it's very hard on children, and usually both partners. But the most important thing you can do is find a partner who you can change with, to be curious and passionate toward, and stop thinking about settling down like a destination you both arrive at and stay. It simply does not exist.",1o88eun,positive
