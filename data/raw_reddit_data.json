    "selftext": "Hi peeps,\n\nI wanna recommend to all of you the tool [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) to you. This is a Rust rewrite of the established Python tool [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com), which is widely used. Pre-commit is a great tool but it suffers from several limitations:\n\n1. Its pretty slow (although its surprisingly fast for being written in Python)\n2. The maintainer ([asottile](https://github.com/asottile)) made it very clear that he is not willing to introduce monorepo support or any other advanced features (e.g. parallelization) asked over the years\n\nI was following this project from its inception (whats now called Prek) and it evolved both very fast and very well. I am now using it across multiple project, e.g. in [Kreuzberg](https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg), both locally and in CI and it does bring in an at least x10 speed improvement (linting and autoupdate commands!)\n\nSo, I warmly recommend this tool, and do show your support for Prek by giving it a star!",

There are other modules along side it (numpy.ma, numpy.typing) but they are not in the numpy namespace unless the numpy/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py module actually includes them. However, when you import modules (i.e import numpy.ma) it loads them from the module file (i.e. numpy/ma.py), not from the numpy packagemodule that was already loaded. import is directory based, with \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py providing modules for packages.\n\n  \nYour idea to \"just import it implicitly\" conflates these two notions, and asks that an import shove a module into a package that didn't include it. I think this would be more confusing than the existing state of affairs. How would conflicts be resolved? Would the one defined by the package module take precedence, or the one defined by a module with the same name?\n\n  \nI hope this helps clarify what is actually happening when you 'import numpy.typing' (load typing.py) vs 'import numpy; numpy.typing' (use typing variable in numpy package module).",

I so wish something could be done with that in the future!\n\nIn contrast, Lua has quite a sane approach: each file is like a body of an argumentless function, and it can define variables local to it as well as globals, and it doesn't export locals by default. You have to `return` explicitly what you wish to be returned by a corresponding `require(...)`. It can even be a number or a string though returning a table (analogous to Python dict) is what's expected; its fields are what the importer would use. What you didn't set up explicitly doesn't get out.\n\n(Great nitpicks about Lua here is (1) `local` is marked and global is unmarked, which is *very* error-prone, compared to Python, because accidentally created globals will indeed leak everywhere; and (2) Lua doesn't allow partial imports, again compared to Python.)\n\nAs Python has class syntax, in principle a Python-like language would would be able to return a class instance if there'd be any faculty of explicitly returning stuff from a module. If Python had \"object literals\" that define a single instance of an unnamed class, using a body just like `class` does (but `__init__` or `__new__` should take no extra arguments), that'd be even more good-looking. Lua comes our alright from this by having a special-cased syntax for string keys in tables and by treating `t.name` the same as `t['name']`, so defining such a table of exports is clean code with no quotes and brackets (and it also allows simultaneously defining a function and assigning it to a key, which again cleans things up in this export scenario).",

Zuban is **20–200× faster than Mypy**, while using roughly half the memory and CPU compared to Ty and Pyrefly. It offers both a PyRight-like mode and a Mypy-compatible mode, which behaves just like Mypy;  \nsupporting the same config files, command-line flags, and error messages.\n\nYou can find the source code [here](https://github.com/zubanls/zuban/).  \nDifferent Python type checkers are compared [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/python/typing/blob/main/conformance/results/results.html).\n\nThe Zuban type checker is now in a very stable state, with many issues resolved and only a few remaining. The next planned features include dedicated support for Django and Pytest.\n\n### Support\n\nIf you have a large Mypy codebase that needs significant bug fixing, I’d be happy to help.",

I don’t want to GPT my way through this degree, I want to know why and how things work, I want to be able to actually critically think and problem solve, I’m not saying people who use AI cannot do this, I’ve heard several senior developers implement these tools in their day to day activities, but I’m saying as a beginner with a foundation which is not so sturdy, if I do rely on AI as a tool or teacher, I might get too dependent on it maybe that’s just a skill issue on my end 😅. \n\nI noticed C is a bit different from these languages cause C is more backend language and is used for compiling, I wouldn’t say it’s a hard language to learn but it’s definitely tricky for me, I don’t really want to use AI to learn it, apart from W3Schools and Youtube videos which other resources like books, blogs, websites can I use to learn this language?\n",

If you learn “older” technologies like C#/.NET or Java, you’re likely to find yourself maintaining legacy systems in large, established companies—especially in industries like banking or fintech. These companies adopted these technologies when they were cutting-edge, and because they prioritize stability and long-term support, they’re unlikely to change their tech stack anytime soon.\n\nAnother consideration with languages like Java and C# is that the field tends to be populated with many seasoned professionals and “gurus.” While you can learn a lot from these experts and gain valuable mentorship, it can also be harder to stand out and advance to higher roles, such as tech lead or principal engineer. The bar is often higher because these roles are filled by very experienced individuals with deep knowledge of the stack.\n\nOn the other hand, newer languages like Python, JavaScript, and Go are popular in the startup world. They’re often chosen because they allow for rapid development and quick iterations—perfect for businesses that need to ship products fast. The trade-off is that these languages tend to favor speed and simplicity over the strict structure and boilerplate you’d find in more traditional languages, making them a great fit for agile, fast-moving teams.\n\nSo, choosing between these languages is often less about technical superiority and more about the type of environment you want to work in—whether you prefer maintaining stable, enterprise-grade systems or building the next big thing in a fast-paced startup.",

I can't be bothered devoting an entire compartment in my brain to unpicking such a tedious clusterphuq, simply to learn new names for stuff I already know, because some Microsoft exec with an MBA didn't want to get sued by Oracle, or wanted to lock devs in to .NET and make it artificially harder to learn Java.\n\nSecondly, I hope I'm wrong, and maybe this goes for Java too (and don't get me started on node_modules) but whenever I install a .NET application, it just feels extremely bloated, needing to download an update for the latest framework.  Or even the entire latest version of the framework, just to keep the damned thing happy, to do a simple task a few MB of C++, 5MB of Rust, or 10MB of Go (including the whole FROM Scratch image) could do in a Docker container.  \n\nI freely admit I'm arguing from a position of ignorance, but if my experience of .NET apps as a user is this bad, I shudder to think what the devx is like.",

A lot of people believe .net is entirely closed-source, or that it’s windows exclusive, or that you have to pay Microsoft to use it. \n\nAnd yes, there is a reddit bias, probably that bleeds over from the political bias on here. There’s also the experience bias, lots of people try python for something because it’s a common go-to prototype language.\n\nThen there’s the front-end people who learn javascript first, and so instead of learning something new for their backend, they just look for the best thing they can do in javascript. A real shame, since js is generally a clusterfuck of a language.\n\nAs for Java, I maintain that in basically all general purpose situations, you can find+replace Java with C# and the outcome is the same. Anyone heavily pro-Java and anti-C# at the same time is almost always for political reasons and very little to do with either language.\n\nI’ll gladly suggest C# to anyone, quick to learn, easy to work with, incredibly flexible in what types of apps can be written, and a huge, well documented ecosystem to work with. \n\nAs for the job market, C# is very common where I am.",

        "body": "A while-loop can do exactly what a for-loop can do. They both exist as to express what the intended purpose is.\n\nFor example, consider this:\n\n```\nint x = set_some_value();\nwhile (x < 25) {\n  do_something();\n  x++\n}\n```\n\nThis is easy to understand. You set X to some value. As long as that value is under 25, you keep doing something. If x starts out at 25 or higher, you do nothing. In this case, using the while-loop, you state that you are going to do something, while x is not yet 25, and you don't know how many iterations that will be.\n\nCompare it to this:\n\n```\nint x = set_some_value()\nfor (x; x < 25; x++) {\n  do_something();\n}\n```\n\nWith the for-loop, you state that you going to do a set number of do_something(); calls, but because the loop starts with x, this set number of calls is actually variable. You are using a loop designed to express a set number of calls to do a variable number of calls. This is less clear than the while loop.\n\nYou normally use a for-loop like this:\n\n```\nfor (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) { ... }\n``` \n\nIn this case you know you are going to loop exactly 25 times. You will know, without having to know anything else about the code, that the loop will start at 0 and end at 24, and that each iteration is available in i. In the previous for-loop example, you wouldn't have known the starting point without looking at the output of set_some_value(), and to know THAT, you may have to look at other code as well.\n\nFor looping over a collection without having to specifically count, many languages have a version of a foreach-loop:\n\n```\nforeach (int x in list) {\n  do_something(x);\n}\n```\n\nYou can do this with a for-loop or a while-loop, but the foreach-loop clearly expresses that you are not interested in the number of iterations, nor the length of the collection 'list'; you just want to do_something() with each value in the list.\n\nSome languages also have an infinite loop, if you want to express that something needs to loop forever, except if something special happens:\n\n```\nloop {\n  int x = get_value();\n  if (x == -1) { break; }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nYou could express it with a while-loop, or a for-loop, or even an until-loop, but the \"loop forever, except ...\" is better expressed with the infinite loop-loop.\n\nAnd as someone else stated: you don't need loops at all. You could use labels and goto's, and then use if-statements with a jump in it, but that is programming in 1950's style.",

It does also sound like there's an increasing amount of IT/dev consulting involving cleaning up some vibe coded crap, so I can only hope I'm not headed for a similar situation.\n\n> If you are not good at solving problems, […]\n\nYeah, software engineering, like pretty much any engineering afaik, is a lot about knowing how to break down problems into smaller pieces until you get to a level you know how to solve, and then synthesising one solution from all the mini-solutions to the mini-problems. More experienced engineers can work on bigger problems at a time, less experienced engineers need to break everything down to very small problems.\n\n> This is by far the worst moment of my life. All my skills (soft skills, language skills, translation, writing, coaching, interviewing people, and so on) are totally useless.\n\n> Sorry for the vent, but this situation is really stressing me out.\n\nYeah, it sounds like a shit situation. Personally I'd like it if you could get a job writing and managing technical documentation. Coders very frequently suck at it, likely not because of any innate problem, but just out of a lack of understanding that technical writing and library management are skills of their own.\n\nIMO more organisations should have dedicated writers and archivists/librarians to help them manage the software and complexity they build. It's a constant complaint from devs and managers as soon as an org gets somewhat large, that they don't have good documentation and that it's too hard to discover, etc, etc. Because maintaining those things is actually skilled work, but for some reason they don't hire skilled workers to perform it, we expect employees with entirely different skills to just magically be good at that as well.\n\nAnd just like in so many other fields, plenty are hoping LLMs will be the silver bullet for that too. I'm not going to hold my breath for an LLM to generate and manage good documentation for an organization it can only model statistically, rather than talk to and _understand_.\n\nAgain, I can only hope you find some meaningful work where you can actually use your skills, because they _are_ valuable, and hopefully will be seen as that again after society's infatuation with these bullshit generators is over.",

This is probably the most important skill. I was a poor communicator during my studies and I had to learn on the job. It supercharges everything you do when you work in a team and across teams. Suddenly you can get other people to do things they don’t want to do too (without being a dick)! Presentation skills are important.\n\n5) Learning and applying good software practices. Have a look at “Uncle Bob” on YouTube or blogs by Martin Fowler. I’m not saying you should take their words as gospel, but they provide food for thought.\n\n6) writing damn good tests. Most of the code you will write in a job will probably be test code.\n\n7) writing *readable* code.

You can make this part of the site as slow as possible, to increase the resource consumption from the bot’s side.\n\nFinally, if you _really_ wanted to screw with bots, specifically MLMs — you could try your hand at prompt injection attacks, imbedded in your site.\n\nNow, as for SEO. There’s no guarantee that what I’ve just told you will help in this respect. In fact, it’s entirely possible that you may harm the reach to legitimate humans. I’d suggest you do more research. But, this stuff may help, if usage by machines is all you care about in principle.",

I am about as religious as a fart in an elevator.\n\nThey asked how I had found god; whereupon I gave them a 10 page essay on meeting some rando, but famous, evangelical minister in a diner, and I sat with him and he \"led me to god's grace\", I then travelled with that minister for a month before he said that it was time for me to spread the word with ministries in my area.\n\nAnd I did have \"proof\" of that. I then had a few friends hand write me glowing praise as tent revival style ministers who said that my quiet enthusiasm was more effective than their louder style.\n\nI had asked a theologian about biblical quotes which could be interpreted as flying bringing you closer to god, and how ministering to primitives is a good thing. (These people were doing that whole deepest Africa sort of thing).\n\nI am certain they called the day they got my application, and basically had two questions. One was about spreading the word in Africa, which is why I instantly had those quotes ready. And the other was if I were gay. \"Will your wife be joining you?\" (I was 20, and of course, I was getting married next fall, and then she would join me)\n\nI had a job offer informally on the phone, and by mail a week later. \n\nThey had all kinds of rules about single men \"including the instructors\" being back in the dorm by such and such a time, no drinking, and others you would expect.\n\nThe pay was good, piloting jobs were thin on the ground, and I still just changed careers instead.\n\n\n-----------------------------\n\nNote: People have mentioned christians paying poorly. This might have been the best paying, by far, junior instructor's job I ever saw. Including a dorm was really kind of cool for someone starting out in this industry. It is not uncommon for junior instructors to have a second job which reliably pays the bills, and to live in hovels with 4 other pilots. There was that one catch, but if that was your bag, then all might have been good. Also, there is a 100% chance I would have spent my idle time corrupting their youth.",

Nobody forces you to use SSR frameworks, nobody forces you to install redux and state management libraries, and nobody stops you from using a separated backend server for API routes.\n\nVue and React already have an excellent state management. Most of the time you don't need any additional state management libraries. Caching is easily done by using the `@tanstack/*-query` library.\n\n>bloated apps with poor performance when a simpler solution would work better.\n\nWe are living in 2025, even the cheapest phones that use Firefox can handle a significant amount of JS code. The \"poor performance\" that you are referring to, I guess, is not really the framework issue. AFAIK poor performance on most websites is caused by layout thrashing, CSS animations/transitions that require DOM re-calculations, or just a dozen of event listeners in the main thread without any kind of debouncing/throttling. This list can go further, but the key idea here is that JS frameworks affect website's performance way less than your own code. It's up to you whether to care or not about DOM limitations.\n\nAlthough React still sucks because of it's monstrous reactivity system (hello 10 re-renders per action) and virtual dom.\n\n>plus dependency management (vulnerabilities, version conflicts, extra maintenance)\n\nTry not to install 15 years old libraries that are not maintained anymore?",

How do you stop comparing yourself to every genius on GitHub?\n\nI just don't compare.\n\nI assess code pragmatically. Does it do the thing? In the existing code are there major shortcomings that require workarounds that could be solved more elegantly? Does this new \"genius way\" achieve that and result in *less* overall code? What are the actual benefits / is it worth rewriting?\n\nIf you don't grow that sense, you'll go insane trying to refactor everything to be the latest and greatest.\n\nWeb dev is kinda odd in that respect. Maybe because the workflow usually involves a high level of 3rd party code integration.

I mean useful to somebody, not necessarily to you.

Today neighbourhoods with the biggest increase in party members per capita get Cuban cigars. Tomorrow neighbourhoods with the worst sales of cigars in the past month get girls' clothes.

If you're a close friend of the shop director (or they owe you a favour), they might keep you something under the counter.

Another was to have a baby--despite officially being about gender equality, it was an open secret that the reality was far from equal, and mothers were seen as unreliable party members because of their tendency to put their kids first, especially if the kid happens to still be a baby.\n\n\nShe told amazing stories about growing up in that time.

        "body": "Not former Soviet republic, but a buffer state (Czechoslovakia back then). Among other things, central planning and its long-term effects. Tl;dr - imagine you have a company and the state tells you how much you should pay, how you should calculate it, how you should anticipate next year and if it does not work out, it is your problem to meet the requirements of the state. People quickly learned that everything is someone else's fault and someone else's problem.  \nIt is of course not typical just to communism/socialism, but the state required huge amounts of data and was so obsessed wih its collection, that it than had no spare capacity to actually work with the data (yes, I know, it is typical for a corporate world today, bear with me for a second). So usually you just took last year's data and made an assumption that this year would be better (because communism marches forward, duh) and set the plan. But this was made at the central level, usually with little regard to different conditions in different parts of a country, or some universal rule for more detailed planning was set.   \nSpecific example - Unified Agricultural Cooperative (in Czech Jednotné zemědělské družstvo, so I will be using the short JZD). JZD was supposed to be an independent agricultural unit where local people put together their land, machinery, cattle etc. and they all worked there (division of labor), managed it together and then split profits (fairly). Central rules dictated that it is supposed to be profitable enough that all people taking part in it would be well-off. So no debt allowed. Also a central rule stated that after a year ended, you sum up what you have earned and divide it among people. Fairly, so another rule - every kind of work had allocated \"work units\" for which you got paid - if you spend a day guarding geese, it was one work unit, if you were driving a harvester, it could be five work units (I am not sure about the number here, but for the general idea). The end year profit was calculated per work unit, not per person.  \nYou see the problem - the people participating in JZD are not going to wait for a whole year to get paid. So it was for example assumed what that year's profits would be (and there were central rules for it or you were even given the assumption), meaning that one work unit will be worth 2 crowns. So people were not actually \"paid\" each month, they received the money as a wage advance. At the end of the year, surprise surprise, the overall profit divided by work units meant that one work unit was worth only 1 crown (bad year or bad initial assumption). So the people got overpaid and they were supposed to give back half of their year's pay. Of course nobody would do that, they were not paid well in the first place, and they thought that they are being robbed by someone higher up. It usually got resolved, but only because someone at the local level, but a bit higher up, was fighting the central hub in Prague through some back-channels and got it covered. So for ordinary people, as long as you put your head in the sand and refuse to give your money back, you get to keep it. For \"management\" of JZD, someone else will solve it and they will receive instructions on how to run their \"bussiness\" for next year. Zero accountability everywhere and that did not dissapear with the fall of the regime.  \nIf anyone reads in Czech, I highly recommend a book Malá doznání okresního soudce by Ota Ulč. It is full of stories like this one.",

As another example, there were ruble stores and \"Berezka\" foreign currency stores - think Soviet duty-free. Now guess who could buy dollars at the official exchange rate of 0.7 rubles/USD instead of 20 rubles/USD black market rate?\n\nAnd those junior party members went on to become the primary beneficiaries of privatisation - CEOs, MPs, \"X Democratic Party\" leaders etc.\n\nMoney by itself may have meant less than it did in Western societies, but it basically just made the entire system even more corrupt and nepotistic. \"Can a colonel's son become general? - Of course not, the general has a son too\".\n\nOn free healthcare - good hospitals and good doctors were also the privilege of the powerful. Sure, you won't pay anything officially, but if you get something serious like a tumour, you and everyone you know would need to call in every favour to maybe get you into something like a military hospital to have a chance of being treated.\n\nOh, and you couldn't just up and move to a bigger city if you're not happy with your life, or easily change careers. Kolkhoz (collective farm) workers didn't have internal IDs up until 1970. It was basically Serfdom 2.0, since it was illegal to travel without an ID.",

This joke would have been considered hilarious by both the Westerners and the Soviet people, but for completely different reasons.

For the Soviets, the joke would have been understood as fantastical absurdity, because *obviously* it's impossible for a store to have so many different types of cheeses, it would be akin to portraying rivers flowing with wine instead of water, and streets being paved with pure gold.

You knew the right kinds of people you’d get fancier higher quality stuff and rare hard to get stuff, but you’d have to give something in return. Nepotism? Totally normal. Also revenge because your family didn’t really follow communism or your uncle was a dissident or something? Yeah, good luck getting into a university and trying to get a better job and life as no university will admit you. \n\nDoctors earned the same wages as your shift brigadier at a factory. \n\nCashiers and any kind of sales person was a GOOD job - you had contacts to get rare or hard to get stuff or even contraband and YOU were the king/queen not the customer. \n\nForeign travel? Most could forget about it. But you did have the whole USSR to travel to + “friendly” socialist countries. But many families hardly ever traveled because 1) needed vacation time off work 2) needed a ticket to go to a fancy spa like resort (and you couldn’t get to those without actually having a ticket and you couldn’t buy tickets, these were handed out at work and there was always a lot less than workers) 3) gas was expensive and cars were not THAT common, buses-trains were main intercity mode of transport and 4) you needed to register at every place you went to at a local police station. \n\nBut if you did travel abroad let’s just say that East Germany was basically considered as the height of socialist development in my country. Now imagine how western countries must have appeared like since we know how east Germany actually was. \n\nKids did learn English, but many actually learned German as a foreign language. Of course Russian wasn’t foreign, but another state language. \n\nWhat people don’t get is that… yeah, there was socialized healthcare, medicine, childcare, even food cafeterias and housing. \n\nIt was all… basic and covered your needs. If you wanted bare minimum, you got it and had it. Plenty of people were very happy with it. \n\nBut you most likely had the exact same carpet, furniture and tea set as your boss unless boss managed to buy something with a bribe or bring something from another socialist state. Many homes looked the same whether you had money or not. \n\nYour home was basic cookie cutter - many apartments were the same basically down to the tiles on the bathroom walls and wallpapers. Your clothes looked similar because they were made with the same fabric available at the store and sewn according to the same instructions from a sewing magazine. Your shoes were the same because the factory produced X number of models and for the whole Soviet Union maybe so they were the same. You and your neighbors most likely had the same type of telephone and car. Your friends had the same bed and desk set and the same pencils, crayons, pens etc. \n\nEverything was the same or similar because this massive industry produced stuff for everybody and yet it wasn’t enough or it wasn’t always good quality, just enough for a basic life. \n\nYour healthcare was okay, but you were lower than dirt as a patient at a hospital - literally at the lowest level, a cleaner was better than you. Also, many older people genuinely still think that you only got to into the hospital to die. \n\nIf you had money, you didn’t really have much to spend it on and generally you didn’t have a lot of money. But you didn’t have much to spend it on anyway so you didn’t exactly feel poor, neglected or anything. \n\nYou didn’t know what to miss since you never had it. \n\nAlso, the USSR was massive. Some things looked the same across the whole union - apartment buildings for example or kindergartens and schools, some food shops. And yet other things were massively different - food availability for example. You’d think that with such a large territory, everybody would have any kind of food available to them, right? But my grandparents and parents hardly ever got any foods from the other republics - I think mandarins, kiwis etc - were very rare things for them until late 1980s. At the best you’d get some watermelon from Ukraine but not even that. \n\nSo just because it was a big union didn’t mean that you’d actually get access to all these national foods or fruits and veg. \n\nAlso how much money was just… spent. Eg massive massive costs on some things that the state didn’t care about which ended basically the day the independence was restored because suddenly the state did not have endless supply of money to print and pay for stuff. ",

I knocked on the door and I heard a voice telling me to come in. I walked into the apartment and made my way to the living room. There was a man sitting on the ground. A wheelchair was on the other side of the room. I asked if he was ok and he told me he had to sleep in the floor because he didn't have a bed. I looked around the apartment and noticed he had no furniture. He only had an overhead light and nothing else. I pulled his order out of the bag and told him the price. He then told me he had no money but hadn't eaten in a few days. I was new at the job and didn't know what the policy would be for something like this. I told him I couldn't give him his pizza and apologized over and over. He told me he understood and I left. \n\nWhen I got back to the store, I told the manager about what happened. He asked me if I wanted to give the guy the pizza. I told him I did but I didn't want to get in trouble. He told me it was ok because he knew I believed the guy and also because of the guy's living situation. The manager walked over to a computer and deleted the order. He then told me to grab a few cans of pop and some wings that were never picked up. He then told me we couldn't do this all the time but there were times when it was the right thing to do and I could make that decision the next time.\n\nI drove back over to the guy's house and knocked on the open door again (he told me to leave the door open because it helped keep the apartment cool. I was called into the apartment and saw the guy was still on the floor. He saw that I was still carrying his order and his face lit up. I told him I was bringing his food back along with some other things. He was so thankful. He told me this food would last him a week and asked me to put everything on the counter. The man them proceeded to thank me. I apologized and told him I wanted to help but I didn't know if it was ok. We talked for a bit before I had to go back to work. \n\nThe whole interaction made me sad. The guy was really nice but handed a shit card in life.

You basically live the rest of your life with a ticking time bomb that can literally go off anytime.\n\n\"My husband suffered his SECOND aneurysm in less than a year last Tuesday. Both times he started talking weird, next thing he couldn't talk at all and was admitted urgently for a stroke. After the first one, it took him days to talk again, he was extremely lucky that nothing else happened. He was trashed for months (tired all the time, very forgetful), prohibited from running/doing heavy lifting. He got cleared to work out a few months ago, started running again and eating healthy, lost weight and was feeling more focused again. Then had his second aneurysm last week, this time I was around and luckily got him to the hospital in less than 8 minutes, same area of his brain erupted. Got attended by the same neurologist, he was looking at him and me like we were aliens, most people just die while we just laughed it off cause what else are you going to do. He has recovered really well and now we are in the talks with the doctors about getting him surgery to fix the area of his brain that has a malformation. We know that he could have died both times or left severely disabled.\"",

Well someone moved in specifically for halloween and first thing they did was put out demon babies being ripped apart in cages and bodies being hung from trees in trash bags. Things that are dying and squirt blood. Halloween night it would look sick, but during the day neighbors were complaining.\n\nThe nosey side of the neighborhood apparently chewed their ears off for it and were knocking down their door. They did their best to make it look more campy and less bloody.

One guy got a $120M sale. Not sales total, but a single sales contract for $120M among his other sales for the year. \n\nIf you want money as your primary target, go into industrial sales... Or windows. Windows guys can make insane commissions.\n\nAnyway, engineers are often paid much higher than the regional average where the role is located and they, and their families, are very comfortable financially.

    "selftext": "**NOTE TO MODERATORS: This is a repost from last night, when it got taken down for repeating recently-discussed topics. I appealed and got the OK to repost it.**\n\nSo, I know that title might sound a little confusing, but hear me out: when Trump was nominated for president the first time in 2016, there was this attitude from the Democratic Party that \"when they go low, we go high.\" [Michelle Obama even said this verbatim](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/07/25/remarks-first-lady-democratic-national-convention). Basically, the idea was that Trump's a massive asshole, which is true, so let's be moral and righteous in the face of that.\n\nWell, I think it's been shown why that strategy was a complete disaster.\n\nLook, I'm not saying that Dems shouldn't be moral in the sense that they should abandon what I view as moral policies (although many of them don't even currently rise to what I would consider to be that level, but that's a story for another day). This is more a personality thing, and how they fight for their agenda. During Trump's first term, Dems were all about redistricting reform, and many states passed independent redistricting commissions to fight gerrymandering, which House Dems at the national level also passed. But now that the GOP is doing mid-decade redistricting in several states, Dems realize that taking the high road in this instance was a losing strategy, and now they're left with no choice but to abandon that principle, at least for now, just to level the playing field. Actually, it's not even to do that, but rather just to make it slightly less disproportionately favorable to the GOP, which it is now in part because of Dems \"taking the high road.\"\n\nMore recently, and this is what motivated me to want to make this post, there's been a scandal in the Virginia Attorney General's race, where the Dem nominee was caught [privately wishing death upon a GOP colleague and his children](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/us/jay-jones-text-messages-va-attorney-general.html). Now, I'm absolutely not going to defend these comments (or the fact that he was stupid enough to text this to a Republican, who would obviously want to use it against him at some point), but I will say that it's pretty interesting how that seemed to get far more attention than the GOP nominee for Lieutenant Governor getting caught [liking Nazi porn](https://newrepublic.com/article/201540/john-reid-virginia-nazi-porn-scandal-gop-personified). I'm not trying to imply that one of these scandals is worse than the other, that's up to you to decide for yourself, but rather that this further illustrates my point: people expect modern-day Republican politicians to be assholes, because - love them or hate them - that's the brand they've created for themselves, so they largely get a pass for it. Democratic politicians, meanwhile, have acted like they have the moral high ground for so long, and that's why they tend to suffer more when engulfed in scandal.\n\nMy main point is that Democratic politicians saw Trump at first as a fluke, and thought they could simply rise above him on a moral/personal level to win support from the public. That may have worked during his first term, but now, he's back and meaner (literally and figuratively) than ever, and they have way too much catching up to do with how far they fell behind in terms bringing equal yet opposite energy.",

The algorithms are designed to influence people.

All this focus on how the dems failed this or that and the lack of accountability for republicans isn’t by accident. It’s all by design. \n\nYou notice how a lot of this administrations actions are currently unpopular even among its base? Don’t you think it’s odd that all of the article headlines and social media feeds are full of “Dems alienated young males” or “Dem party is falling apart” or “both sides bad” when so much turmoil and suffering is happening under the current admin? It’s intentional. It empowers MAGA while disillusioning anyone else paying attention.\n\nYou even see it with the conservatives “going against” Trump like MTG or Tucker Carlson. They say they disagree about this or that from this administration, but at the end of the day they still support Trump. Best case scenario they realign conservatives and independents to keep voting for MAGA or worst case scenario they convince them to give up and sit out the next few elections.

But, we could discuss other politicians going far lower in private to harm the American people, sell out jobs, economically, etc which is far worse, but that’s a discussion for another time. \n\nBack to the topic at hand. The reality is, my entire life, I’ve been pretty much moderate, center right. All I’ve ever heard is how dumb republicans are; Clinton called them “deplorables”, etc. Every bit of pop culture and almost all news was anti anything conservative no matter what. across all areas of life it’s been a known thing to just sort of be a quiet conservative or you will likely be lambasted by people on the far left, hated, or at the very least misunderstood with no desire from them to have an open discussion to find common ground. Now, it’s only gotten worse. Now if you’re conservative, you’re a Nazi. Full stop, You’re hate filled. Your business should be set a blaze and abandoned (Twitter, Tesla, etc). Your very identity as a rational person…or even a person is removed. When that personhood is removed, you end up with assasinations like Charlie Kirk and the ones attempted on the pres. \n\nFWIW, most moderate republicans didn’t even like Trump when he first came around. I certainly didn’t vote for him the first time. The media created him because they gave him all the air time so they could sell ad space. \n\nAt the end of the day, I think it has far less to do with “going high” and more just getting the job done. The current generation is doing quantifiably worse than their parents for the first time in America’s history. That’s BOTH sides of the “aisle” fault, and None of that was clearly changing and people wanted change. \n\nTrump, ultimately, is barely a Republican at all, he is more of a representative of an outside figure coming to change the system. Most of the people who teamed up with him were Dems anyway. I’m not saying he’s succeeding, but it’s obvious to anyone watching it NEEDS to change. Trillions in debt and no real ideas to change it. Dems need to focus less on hating Trump, and more on actually formulating and communicating ideas and policies that will make lives better for the average person. Cheers ✌️",

Even if you disagree with its politics it's just a well performed, well directed, human story. \n\nWithout any spoilers, it's very much focused on America's crackdown on illegal immigration, and the activism against this.\n\nIt highlighted something I believe is prevalent across a great deal of left leaning activism: the assumption that everyone already agrees deportations are bad.\n\nMuch like the protestors opposing ICE, or threatening right wing politicians and commentators. They seem to assume everyone universally agrees with their cause.\n\nUsing this example, as shocking as the image is, of armed men bursting into a peaceful (albeit illegal) home and dragging residents away in the middle of the night. \n\nEven when I've seen vox pop interviews with residents, many seem to have mixed emotions. Angry at the violence and terror of it. But grateful that what are often criminal gangs are being removed. \n\nRather than rally against ICE, it seems the left need to take a step back and address:\n\n1. Whether current levels of illegal mmigration are acceptable.\n2. If they are not, what they would propose to reduce this.\n\nThis can be transferred to almost any left wing protest I've seen. Climate activists seem to assume people are already on board with their doomsday scenarios. Pro life or pro gun control again seem to assume they are standing up for a majority. \n\nTo be clear, my cmv has nothing to do with whether ICE's tactics are reasonable or not. It's to do with efficacy of activism. \n\nMy argument is the left need to go back to the drawing board and spend more time convincing people there is an issue with these policies. Rather than assuming there is already universal condemnation, that's what will swing elections and change policy. CMV. \n\nEdit: to be very clear my CMV is NOT about whether deportations are wrong or right. It is about whether activism is effective. ",

        "body": "I think it's a bit more complicated.\n\nThe left has more working against them than the right. \n\nEverything you pay attention to, learn, experience, process, etc. shapes your perception/worldview. Since we are all paying attention to, learning, and experiencing different things, we all experience the world through different lenses. You can be in the same room with someone, technically experiencing the same thing, but your experience and interpretation of that moment could be radically different. \n\nThis has been exacerbated by the internet, which is a firehose of information (often out of context, misinformation, disinformation/propaganda), as well as more people having higher education, more exposure to different people's ideas and experiences, etc.\n\nNo one knows what another person believes, has experienced, is educated about, etc. unless you get to know that person on a deeper level. \n\nThe right wing base tends to be whiter, more male, more rural, less educated, more religious, etc. \n\nThe left wing base tends to be more multicultural/ethnically diverse, more urban, more educated, more female, etc.\n\nThis means that the right is able to pander to the lowest common denominator. There's a reason why the right talks a lot about \"common sense\". They think that everyone else experiences the world the same way that they do, and because they typically have a more limited/one dimensional understanding of how the world works, their solutions to problems usually oversimplify or misunderstand the problem. \n\nIt's a lot easier to convince someone that we need to mass deport immigrants when a) they feel their own circumstances worsening, b) they see an increase in visible minorities from different cultures and speaking different languages. There is a connection between these two things, but its a correlation, not a causation, but those in power benefit from people's ignorance. There's a reason why the right wing thinks that going to college/university is liberal indoctrination (and why those in power have directed the right's disdain particularly towards social sciences and the humanities (i.e. \"woke\"). The right wing benefits from people having a poor understanding of history and society. Higher education exposes you to a wide range of ideas, as well as a wide range of people that they would not have been exposed to if they stayed in, say, a predominately white small town.\n\nThis exposure to a variety of people, experiences, ideas, etc. also has the effect of increasing empathy (in higher education and in urban settings). If your roommate is an immigrant, your friends have different experiences and views on the world, and you take courses that expose you to a variety of perspectives, including those of people who aren't white, straight, male, Christian, conservatives , you're more likely to develop empathy to people who are different from you and who may have pieces to life's \"puzzle\" that you don't have (rather than seeing them as \"outsiders\" and being distrusting of outgroups). \n\nLeft wing ideas generally involve power analysis and understanding the larger systems/structures shape our lives. Right wing ideas tend to be about rugged individualism. This automatically makes a lot of left wing ideas more difficult to understand, because not everyone learns how to engage in systemic thinking (or apply it consistently). Left-wing policies tend to be more evidence-based whereas right-wing policies are tend to be more based on emotion and values (at least on the surface). \n\nBoth the Democrats and the Republicans represent their wealthy donors and corporations over regular people. This means that there is not a left wing party, and there aren't very many wealthy people who want to back people who tend towards anti-capitalism and fighting for human rights for everyone. This means that real leftist ideas are not widespread (Republicans, Democrats, and mainstream media generally don't do much class analysis), and when left wing ideas are presented, they are typically a caricature or misrepresented or dismissed as unrealistic (see Bernie Sanders, who was largely ignored by mainstream media, despite all his grassroots support, and who in 2020, MSNBC Host Chris Matthews suggested (indirectly) might execute people in Central Park if elected). Since most people aren't deeply political (and due to propaganda), a lot of people don't even differentiate between the left and Democrats (which makes it easier to think that left wing policies don't work, as their policies are usually only half measures and still benefit the wealthy and corporations more than regular people). \n\nThe internet exposes us to a lot of different ideas, but those ideas are often out of context and require background information to understand. So like, two people could be debating a topic on reddit and one might have a PhD in the topic and the other might be a high school student. The high school student is not likely to have the education/life experience to understand the topic on the same level as the person with the PhD. Or even if its not a debate and you're simply reading someone else's perspective or conversations between other people and the content assumes the reader has a more in depth perspective. Not all content is going to have a 101 explainer because people want to engage in deeper conversations than that. \n\nThe right wing used their resources to propagandize heavily regarding \"culture war\" topics. This really took off during Gamergate in 2014. A lot of right wing influencers made a lot of money making \"anti-SJW\" content, taking someone from the left who is passionate and angry, may be a poor spokesperson for the movement, may be taken out of context or misrepresented, or that they or their audience don't have the background knowledge to understand. \n\nSo basically:\n\nRight wing: Backed by wealthy donors, appeals to low information/low education voters who are more susceptible to propaganda, more homogenous (and more likely to be made up of the dominant groups), more responsive to fear mongering and appeals to emotion and religion, and more likely to agree with simple, \"common sense\" solutions.\n\nLeft wing: More likely to require a deeper education to understand or to have lived experience (i.e. navigating the world as a minority or a woman). They are more likely to be people targeted by the right wing's policies. Less resources to get their message out there. Lots of well-funded propaganda against them. Supported policies tend to be evidence-based (and propaganda has made a lot of people distrustful of academics) and may not be apparent to the average person, may require more upfront costs, bigger change, and the positive outcomes may not be evident in the short-term; also you have to convince a wider range of people that its in their interest to work together for all of our best interests in a society that is very individualized. \n\nSo my argument is basically that no one knows what other people know unless you get to know them on a deeper level. The right wing has an easier time appealing to \"common sense\" and emotions. The left wing has more of a challenge because you need more \"building blocks\" to understand left wing ideas and policies. And while some people on the left have been swayed through emotion and fear (appeals to empathy, for example), because the left wing cares about policy and ideas that actually work to improve the lives of people, they also care more about being rooted in reality. The left is also trying to reach more diverse people and have less access to resources to facilitate that reach. \n\nSuccessful organizing requires you to *meet people where they are at* (in terms of understanding, engagement, and location), and its a more complicated and longer road for the left. We can't just appeal to fear, emotion, God, the Bible, nationalism, white/male supremacy, lower taxes, etc. the way the right can. \n\nWith the right being more religious and a lot of their leaders jumping on the Trump train, the religious right has natural community through their churches, homeschool groups, etc. where they are taught the same things as each other. Since capitalism is increasingly eroding community, and because we need to reach people from many different walks of life (including different religions and no religion), we have to intentionally create our own community spaces, convince people to come, and ensure that the spaces are welcoming for as many people as possible (and balancing making it a safe space for marginalized groups, while also making it a place where people can learn and grow and make mistakes, can be a difficult tightrope to navigate).",

The intuitive way to understand \"defund the police\" is \"abolish the police\" . The activist left went all in on this slogan for a period. How did voters respond ? In New York City (a bastion of left wing politics), after months of protestors chanting \"defund the police\" , voters responded by voting for Eric Adams, an ex cop, who promised more not less police spending. Those protests utterly backfired, despite police brutality remaining a severe problem. Supporting common sense restrained policing would have gotten you labelled a supporter of Jack booted thugs and fascism by this group in this period. \n\n\nB) Latinx: for a period every left wing activist and journalist glommed onto this phrase, seemingly everyone in the democratic Party machine was using this word except hilariously one specific group: actual Latinos. This word seems rightly dead today, but in the half decade it was popular how much damage did the party do with Latino voters, many of whom swung to voting Republican. In this period if you did use Latino a loud minority would have torn into you for being sexist. Ridiculous. \n\n\nC) Gender issues. Activists have generally taken an absolutist position that runs counter to common sense by the bulk of working class society. I despise Trump, and the people behind him but when their campaign released the slogan \"Kamala is for they/them, Trump is for YOU \" it was absolute genius, and captured the way the democratic activist class had gotten completely disconnected from the reality of its working class voter base and that voting base's values.

Right wing media figures generally only play with home team advantage, or against college students. With rare exception, you won't find serious debates between the big right wing influencers/politicians and the big left wing influencers/politicians. Let alone Fox, which at this point are just Party Political Broadcasts. There are left leaning news channels attempting a kind of neutrality, but its arguably a bit irresponsible because it's not reciprocated - so polarisation is logical.\n\nWith all that said, there's also another crucial issue - who are \"the left\"? If you mean the Democrats, Biden tried to pass a bilateral immigration bill with a lot of Republican input. Republicans shot the bill down and delayed actual legislation on the immigration issue for a year or so. So you kind of have a multiplicity of issues here and you can pretty much put all of them at the feet of the current insanity in the US right.\n\n\\- Right generally won't talk to Left even in the form of debate given neutral moderation / even numbers\n\n\\- Republicans generally won't do bipartisanship since Obama regardless of the issue\n\n\\- An unprecedented lack of decorum and respect on behalf of the President and party in general makes the base hostile to Democrats and more insular/cultish generally\n\nUnder these conditions, attempting to engage in good faith is basically self harm, all downside. It's better just to focus on effective activism than contend with a national scale echo chamber. Consensus building and bipartisan problem solving requires cooperation, but current US politics are fundamentally adversarial. Can you even imagine Trump or another key figure sitting down to seriously discuss drawbacks of their policy with anyone at any time, let alone a Democrat?\n\nFinally, what is activism? To me, activism is trying to make a difference on the ground. There are ENDLESS youtube videos, documentaries, literature reviews, papers, university debates etc etc discussing immigration, climate, guns, abortion. At what point may activists begin actual activism? Is there a threshold of agreement that must be reached? To me an activist is not a person who is trying to convince, but a person trying to act - it's the first three letters of the name.",

I sometimes think the right wishes the left were wholly, 100% against any kind of border enforcement because it would make their messaging easier and it would make their opponents a easier target for scorn and ridicule. Podcast and talk radio pundits can craft whatever narrative they like about the protestors. Who really knows what each protestor believes unless you talk to them? Perhaps many of them will tell you they want the hardened violent criminals to be deported or that there should be stronger enforcement at the border, but they don't like students being arrested for opinion blog posts. Maybe some of them wouldn't even call themselves left-wing -- perhaps they are for lower taxation but also feel passionate about civil rights. What do you think they believe? How do you know?\n\nAs for whether protests are effective, would segregation have ended without the civil rights protests? Would the US have entered more protracted and costly wars in the 1970s and 1980s if the Vietnam War protests didn't happen? Would the USSR have lasted longer if it weren't for mass protests against communist autocrats? Protesting will always make some people uneasy because it challenges the status quo and certainty in their daily lives -- that tomorrow will be like yesterday. People's attentional budgets are so limited that protest is the only way to know that someone actually cares about a given issue. Sometimes that initial irritation, after reflection, turns into support. Republicans who once derided OIF protestors now regard the war as a failure and campaign on non-interventionism.\n\nThere was a time when Republicans and Democrats talked about immigration. There was a comprehensive immigration [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security,_Economic_Opportunity,_and_Immigration_Modernization_Act_of_2013) in 2013 called the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Reform Act of 2013. It would have greatly expanded border enforcement before the mass migration waves mid-decade. In fact, it would have funded 40,000 new, permanent border patrol officers. This would have given CBP the resources to prevent the inflow of illegal border crossings over the past decade. However, it also would have streamlined a lot of the bureaucracy for legal immigration, improved efficiency, and decreased processing times for people following the rules. It would have punished the misuse of the H1B visa program and provided more enforcement teeth. Certain critical need grads who met certain stringent eligibility requirements would have been able to apply for green cards. A merit-based, points immigration system would have been created to prioritize skilled work visas with broad coverage of different professions across all industries. A new W visa would have gated the entrance of \"low skill\" workers, requiring them to be strongly vetted. The bill had strong bipartisan support. It would tighten the border while creating sound standards for legal immigration and removing bureaucratic bottlenecks. \n\nRepublican Senators Marco Rubio and Lindsey Graham co-sponsored the bill, made substantial changes to it that had President Obama's backing. It passed the Senate 68-32. Many House Republicans supported it. For a moment, it seemed the bill would coast through the House until it didn't. Ultimately, the House leadership let the bill die without a floor vote. A decade of congressional obstinance on any meaningful immigration reform followed -- this must be a factor in the migration problem metastasizing.\n\nIs the problem that the left needs to \"go back to the drawing board\"? Does congressional obstinance have anything to do with it? Do you think there is any credence to the idea that the administration wants to make legal immigration illegal so they have a pretext to deport legal immigrants? To what extent do you think it is reasonable to expand interpretation of Article II executive powers? Is the $100K H1B fee a tax or is a legitimate cost to process an H1B application? If it's a tax, then it's an Article I power.",

Just make it worse for the employers and then they’ll stop hiring undocumented immigrants and then people won’t want to move here in the first place. \n\nOne of the main reason people risk it all to come to the States is because they know they’ll be able to send money back home with the salary they make in American dollars.\n\nIf there isn’t an incentive to come and stay illegally, people won’t come here as much. \n\nSince it would implode several industries to do this all at once, give businesses ample time to prepare. Give them amnesty for the undocumented workers they already hire but make them prove their new hires are legalized to work.\n\nEdit: Some of you are confusing something being illegal with it being criminalized. Just because there is a law against it doesn’t make it a crime.

        "body": "So there are criminal penalties, if there's a pattern. But importantly, civil and criminal penalties are leveled with different burdens of proof. Criminal penalties require the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard. Civil penalties merely require a preponderance of the evidence. That makes it far easier to punish people for hiring undocumented immigrants, specifically because you don't have to prove the \"knowingly\" portion with such rigor. It's actually very difficult bar to clear. But once there is a pattern established through civil penalties, those penalties will certainly help establish the \"knowingly\" prong required for criminal burden.\n\nWe can't change the burden of proof standards for just a single crime, it's kind of an all or nothing deal. The question really is about whether the \"knowingly\" portion should need to be a prong of the offense at all. It sounds like you want some sort of \"negligent\" standard instead. But I would disagree. The offense of \"giving someone money as part of a consensual contract\" just isn't a big enough deal to establish such strict liability. Hiring an undocumented immigrant is not drinking and driving - you're not risking anyone's life or health. You're just not doing paperwork properly that's biggest drawback is you just gave someone money that the government doesn't want living here for largely political reasons.\n\nI also want to point out reducing the standard for criminality could backfire against Americans as well. There are Americans that don't have a passport or social security card and have to rely on lesser known documents. The other C documents, like Native American Tribal Documents are ones that Americans in general are less familiar with. Enforcing criminal penalties on small employers for negligence may incentivize employers to be unwilling to hire employees that rely on documents that the employers are unsure about - resulting in unintentional discrimination.",

    "selftext": "The United States is built on two workforces. Cheap immigrant labor and highly technical educated labor.\n\nCheap immigrant labor is used in every facet of labor intensive industries. All resource extraction, construction, agriculture, manufacturing, food processing, shipping, etc uses it extensively. These immigrants are being targeted for removal by the Trump administration. Without these bodies to do the work these sectors will not be able to function. Removing this cheap labor also increases the price floor of labor for these industries and all others as well. So even if the industries can fill the vacancies the price for labor will drastically reduce or even eliminate their profit margin and the impacts all industries.\n\nHighly technical educated labor produces advanced tech goods and services. Amazon, Facebook, tesla, spacex, Nvidia, Microsoft, Boeing, lockeed Martin, Raytheon, etc all depend heavily on an educated labor force. This labor force is educated in liberal education systems. By this I mean a system that at least attempts to teach critical thinking. This is not a trait that is taught under fascism. Educated labor force is also acquired by importing educated immigrants who will not be coming or let in to the US in the current numbers under facism. By eliminating the educated labor pool tech industries will not be able to function.\n\nThe US is also a consumption based economy. Increasing the cost of goods consumed in the US by either reducing the labor force and increasing its cost through deportation reduces how much can be consumed. Increasing the cost by imposing tarrifs also reduces consumption. The reduced consumptions reduces profits.\n\nMuch of the entertainment industry is very liberal either by the people producing it or the content of the media and by what the consumers want. Disney and others would have severely curtailed profits under facism.\n\nBlue states/cities subsidies red states/counties to an alarming degree. I have never personally had to do precise technical work while being threatened be I doubt I would be very effective in my work. Sending in military and paramilitary personal into blue areas under facism is threatening every worker of every industry in those areas. Productivity will decrease leading to financial hardships for companies.\n\nI honestly don't really care about company bottom lines as much as not living in a facist dictatorship but I really don't understand why companies are supporting this when, imo, a great many won't survive or will be greatly curtailed finacially.",

Part of that is a cheap labor market from uncontrolled immigration.  Uncontrolled immigration helps business owners by suppressing labor costs.  If the US turned fascist (I consider a 0% chance), government would control everything, killing entrepreneurs and the free market.  Preferred companies would do well while the overall economy would eventually suffer horribly, IMO.  Long term, the economy becomes very average and weak compared to our past.

Nazi Germany was able to produce a huge number of highly technical professionals to make it's economy work. In fact one of the primary reasons it was such a dangerous opponent in WWII is because it had extremely advanced military technology at the time. There's nothing inherently *illogical* about fascism, it just has issues with both of our moral values. \n\nYou keep talking about removing immigrants increases the base cost of goods manufactured in the US. Sure, but it also increases the wages of those base jobs. Once the bottom of the wage pool goes up so does the rest. There would be an adjustment period but we don't get poorer overall without mass immigration in the long run. Many of these immigrants also send huge amounts of money back to their home countries, money that's **not** being used to consume in the US. If they were no longer here that money would stay in our economy. \n\n>Much of the entertainment industry is very liberal either by the people producing it or the content of the media and by what the consumers want. Disney and others would have severely curtailed profits under fascism.\n\nSo it's not possible for new entertainment companies to appear if the current ones are going out of business? There's no basis for the assumption that the entertainment industry would just collapse if *liberal* media was censored or not tolerated. There would be new companies (or existing ones that lack your moral fortitude) that would be making acceptable media. \n\nWhat makes you think technical workers who are citizens will be threatened by the government at all? As I pointed out above many fascist states have had highly competent and successful technical industries. There's no real evidence that either threatening is a feature of fascism for technical professionals or even if it were that it makes a significant impact in output. \n\nI have no interest in living in a fascist government, but one of the things that does flourish under fascism (at least in the short to moderate term) is private companies. Sure some of them die, mostly if they fail to join the party, but private industry is supported and the government will protect *important* industries much more seriously than a free market economy like we currently have. \n\nThe real problem with Fascism isn't any of the stuff above, it's the fact that it's a centrally planned system. Centrally planned systems have structural weaknesses to unexpected and/or poorly understood disruptions to their economies. This usually takes decades to manifest in a seriously damaging way though.

I didn't think it was important to clarify which party I am talking about because the vast majority of people will probably not be familiar with it anyways, but since the question has come up a ton, I am going to answer it: The party in question is called AfD. The politician who said \"The AfD in general is against women's rights.\" is Björn Höcke. \n\nHowever, multiple members of the party are openly sexist and misogynistic and the party itself doesn't do anything about it. One of their members (Andy Shöngart) sent a student (a minor!) messages saying he hoped she would get SAd. Andy Schöngart was even found guilty by a court in this matter and the party did not distance itself from him but he even received a promotion. That is just one of many examples of their misogynistic behaviours.",

Someone might say that doesn't matter because the way they define Fish Hating includes when someone does anything that even indirectly harms fish or even if they do nothing and their lack of action doesn't help fish in some way. \n\nFrom their fish-focused point of view it kind of makes sense, but from your I-wasn't-really-even-thinking-about-fish point of view it seems like a weird non sequitur. You don't care about fish particularly, or you do care but you think the tradeoff is worth it for now, or you have some more sophisticated take about how much fishing in the region is optimal for the fish population, or whatever. From your own perspective it doesn't make sense at all to think of yourself as a Fish Hater.\n\nPlus, even from the Fish Lover's own point of view, by their extremely broad definition of Fish Hating almost everyone in the world is a Fish Hater, which is not a useful way to discern much except distinguishing between your small cabal of ideological purists and literally everyone else. \n\nSo sure you can play the word game where you define the word in an extremely broad way, and other people who have a more narrow definition may argue with you about the definition, but in the end it is just a semantic game you're playing.

Are these positions in the official party platform in a tangible way?\n\n2) Voting against a particular law as represented in headlines is often misleading. Sometimes that law is poorly written with other bad consequences. Sometimes its packaged with other things that they were against.\n\n3) 'Want women to return to 'traditional roles'' is again vague. What is tangible in their platform?\n\nAssuming they are against women's rights, is it fair to say everyone voting for them is misogynist?\n\n4) I don't think I support this either, though it partially depends. There are many reasons to vote for a party, there are many single issue voters. Lets pretend this party is also the most green party, taking climate change seriously and voter X thinks this is the most important issue in the world. I think it would be wrong to conclude X is a misogynist. That title is only fairly applied to people who hold misogynistic opinions. The depends is on how prominent the parties' anti women platform is. It could be a major component or such a small part that no one expects them to really act on much and thus it can be overlooked.\n\n\\*Ultimately I feel only people who hold misogynistic opinions should be called misogynistic.

Sure, childcare might be a nice option, but saying the government should foot the bill for it isn't a misogynistic view. \n\nAlso, if they express a viewpoint for a traditional family, but don't attach that to an law or action of the state, that's just an opinion/advice that doesn't impact rights in any way.\n\nBut the broader point that *anyone voting for the party is a misogynist* is absolutely wrong because the voter might not be motivated at all by these policies because there are broader issues at play that could have tangible effects on the country as a whole and the voter personally that has nothing to do with \"women's rights\".",

    "title": "CMV: The \"explore now that you're young, settle down later\" makes no sense",
    "selftext": "My girlfriend of four years recently ended our relationship because she's afraid of missing out on being young. We're 22 and 23 respectively. Her reasoning was straightforward, she has her whole life to settle down and have a family & a house... but she won't be young forever. She feels like she needs to explore now or she'll regret it when she's 40. She says she loves me like she's never loved anybody and the relationship is perfect, but she's clearly contradictory about the matter.\n\nThis is an incredibly common narrative, even a normal doubt amongst much more mature relationships. I think our culture reinforces this idea that you must prioritize exploration in your twenties or you'll somehow miss your chance. The thing is, that doesn't make much sense to me. When you actually break down the logic, it's completely backwards.\n\nLet me explain myself. There are essentially two paths people talk about, exploring and being single versus committing to build a life with someone. The cultural wisdom says you have limited time for the first and unlimited time for the second. Which is what she argues too. But I feel like reality is exactly the opposite.\n\nExploring and being single has no real constraints. You don't need anyone else's cooperation. There's no biological clock. You can travel, meet new people, go to bars, have casual relationships at literally any age. Twenty-five, thirty, forty, it doesn't matter. The option is always there. It requires no external validation, no compatible partner, nothing. Just your own decision to do it. Of course responsibilities can play a part in it, but it's still much easier than the other side of the coin.\n\nBuilding a committed relationship and family, on the other hand, has very real time constraints. You need to find someone compatible, which isn't guaranteed at all in life and takes time. If you want children, there are fertility windows that narrow with age. It requires another person's commitment and timing to align with yours. You can't just decide at thirty-five that you're ready and make it happen. These things are outside your control.\n\nI'm not saying exploration is bad or that everyone should settle down young. I'm saying the timeline argument that's used to justify this choice is fundamentally flawed. It's postponing the thing with actual difficulty to prioritize what's available whenever one wants.\n\nThe response I usually hear is \"but it's not the same to explore at thirty-five as at twenty-two.\" Fine, maybe the experience is different. But it's also not the same to try to start a family at thirty-five as at twenty-five, and in that case the difference is biological reality, not just vibes.\n\nI think this narrative we've created actually sets people up to struggle. We tell them to postpone the difficult, time-constrained thing to prioritize the easy, always-available thing. Then surprise! they have trouble with what they postponed. If anything long term relationships have been declining because now more than ever people don't work through rough patches.",

        "body": "Whether or not this changes your view, I want to share something that I wish I understood an internalized much earlier in life. \n\n\nYou're changing monthly if not weekly or daily when you're young and still figuring out life. That's observably true in settings like high school and college. What people won't tell you is that it continues into your twenties thirties forties fifties, you're changing until the day you die, constantly becoming the person who you will be next. It feels like we're simultaneously sold two lies:\n\n\n1. People don't *really* change\n2. That we can \"Settle down\" when we finally realize who we are and what we want.\n\n\nYou hear a lot of #1 from people getting out of fractured relationships. What they are really saying is *I wanted this person to be somebody else, and they weren't willing to be that.* It could be as simple as more organized or less of a slob. It's so obvious to you, *why don't they see how they could just do better and it would make life easier for them and you!*\n\n\nBut the truth is people are constantly changing, which ties into #2, and your cmv. They're just changing because *they want to*, there's an intrinsic motivation, not an extrinsic penalty. \n\n\nOne of the reasons why really good couples divorce between year 5 and 12 is that despite having children, buying a house, planning a future, having so much shared life together, what's also happening is you have two adults who are still changing, and those newly drifted-apart humans are no longer aligned enough to stay partners. They were both changing, but they weren't in tune with each other's changes. They'll see all the bad changes in their partner, and perhaps point to the good changes they've made. Scumbag human brain, this is an evolutionary adaptation.\n\n\nFor your girlfriend, it sounds like she's on the front end of this. She's worried she'll miss out on experiences because she's tied down. There are also a lot of women who experience this in their early forties after starting families and feeling like they are stuck. Men tend to experience this too as a midlife crisis, but they're less likely to look at the marriage as an anchor. It's a human condition, that feeling never truly leaves us.\n\n\nSo the reason your view is worth updating is the same reason the inverse is also wrong, or at least incomplete. The only way our relationship survives, at any age, at any stage, is if you have two people changing in harmony. They (you) have to continue to be curious and patient with who the other person is becoming. And it's not even themselves (former you), insofar as the person who met their changing partner 4 years ago, it's the new person you've become being in tune with the new person they've become. The best way to visualize this is four distinct people in stages of metamorphosis. And that repeats in perpetuity. If the grass doesn't get watered, it does start to look greener elsewhere. But it's never the same grass as what was planted.\n\n\nAnd it's difficult to not internalize it, but often times break-ups are natural bbecause of this constant evolution. I really wish this weren't the case after marriage, because it's very hard on children, and usually both partners. But the most important thing you can do is find a partner who you can change with, to be curious and passionate toward, and stop thinking about \"settling down\" like a destination you both arrive at and stay. It simply does not exist. ",

We were about to get married and she had concerns about the what ifs. We were each other's first love and the spark that we had when we first started dating went downhill near year 6 - 7. We actually fulfilled both sides of your argument too: we traveled numerous times a year (tropical islands, national parks, west coast, east coast, whatever). We bought property too, starting with a condo in a expensive metropolitan city in the US and then a nice SFH in the suburbs. I was very resentful when we broke up, as she brought up the same arguments about the biological clock, not knowing if I was the forever somebody, and the what-ifs. \n\nIt's been 3 years since then and I learned a lot. People change. Life isn't logical. Everybody has different things they value and it could change at any time. Vacations / traveling doesn't replace fulfillment or happiness. A big beautiful house doesn't automatically make you happy. If you're planning for the future for the sake of planning for the future, you'll just end up in a relationship filled with resentment. Find somebody that shares your values, I did and you will too. \n\nAnyways, hopefully this gives you closure.

It is much harder to casually experience the joys of life if you are nurturing an infant or making sure a toddler isn't about to accidentally maim themselves. \n\nEven parents of high school kids have a ton of obligations, if they're trying to be good parents and set their kids up for success. They'll be enrolling them in after school programs, chauffeuring them around, networking with parents of friends, etc. \n\nIt really is not the same as being single or building your own career. \n\nI'm childless by choice, in my 40s. My social circle is mostly childless adults in their 30s-50s, with a few adults whose children are teenagers or adults. Any of my friends who've had young babies now struggle to stay connected with people like me. Their entire life revolves around raising the next generation. That's how it should be, but it is NOT a choice to make lightly. \n\nIt's a massive responsibility and a lot of sacrifice. \n\nAnd people have different priorities in what they want out of life. If family is among your top priorities, then yes, it is better to start young, and everything you said in your post is true. \n\nBut if your top priority is a career in entertainment or art, then family is going to be a major drag on that ambition, and it is best to put it off until your career is established (or until you gave it your best attempt). \n\nOther people might be prioritizing a career in medicine, or athletics, or they want fame and fortune as an entrepreneur. Or maybe they place a high priority on exploration via travel. All of these things are very difficult to achieve or establish with kids.  \n\nI know a professional ballerina who put off having kids until her 30s. Dancers cannot work while pregnant and changes in their body shape does have a major impact on their career. \n\nBottom line: Family is a noble value, and those who value it should settle down young if they can.

There’s something for everyone, and there’s no shame in choosing whatever path works best for you, and not spending too much time and energy trying to fit into a mold that doesn’t suit you.\n\nBottom line is, you do you. There is no one person who knows the best path in life. The best path will vary from person to person.",

There just aren't that many people in their thirties and forties who want the same thing, so it is much harder to do during that period of life.

        "body": "This is not the mainstream experience, but I'll share mine. I was raised a pastor's kid in the US evangelical bubble and purity culture of the 90's and 00's. I met my wife at a Christian college and we got married at 21. I am now 36. I've since deconstructed my faith and no longer consider myself Christian. Being in the culture at the time, my wife and I didn't so much as kiss until we dated for 7 months. We had sex for the first time on our wedding night.\n\nI've had a hard wired spanking fetish since I can remember. If you don't know much about it, it's almost like it's own sexual orientation, and people refer to themselves as 'spankos'. It's not just a 'preference' but a very specific longing for connection. Given my lack of sexual experience I thought it was a common thing. My wife and I did discuss it before we got married, but all she could really say was that she'd try it.\n\nIt turned out she hated it and wanted nothing to do with it, and it was a source of bitter arguments and resentment for almost 14 years. On top of that, purity culture in general really fucked things up for us and we had to go back and unlearn a lot of unhealthy patterns around sex in general.\n\nEven with therapy, I couldn't make the fetish go away, and I felt like I was trapped. It became this cycle of shame, trying to give it up, only to have it resurge and cause frustration and temptations to cheat (which I never acted on). I felt anger and grief that I had to hide such a core part of myself from my own partner. For her, she felt like she wasn't good enough and couldn't make me happy. It was a mess. Along the way we discovered she is autistic, so sensory issues and anxiety are a big factor, and those just can't be fixed. It felt like gridlock.\n\nThings finally came to a head last year where we finally reached the point of just feeling too sexually incompatible to stay married. We have two kids and splitting up over such a specific thing that just wouldn't fit just felt heartbreaking, especially after all the work we put into our relationship. I felt like I tried everything to make it go away.\n\nThat was when we finally found a sex positive non-christian therapist and learned that there are other ethical options to get those needs met from others outside the marriage with boundaries in place. It's been a big factor in me finally leaving the faith system I was raised in, and branching out to discover other perspectives on ethical sex. It's been a complete game changer for us. Negative patterns we had for over a decade started to fade away. My wife and I even talk about my experiences and she feels no jealousy because we are more secure than ever in our bond.\n\nI love her dearly, but it would have saved us both so much pain if I had explored and affirmed that part of me early on so I could have met someone who shares that, because it did not go away and only got more desperate the older I got. What we have now works but I still wish it could be her, and it's not the solution I would have preferred or chosen. I'm thankful for where things are now, but I feel robbed of the time in my 20's and early 30's where I had to repress such a core part of myself.",

Great page for advice on break ups. \n\nThis is a personal decision with no objective correct standard or rationale. This is not subject that is capable of objective debate or objective truths. Your ex’s position is valid and shared by the majority of people your age and the VAST majority of people over 35. It isn’t a coincidence that this advice is so common, it is because life experience will teach you that it is the correct POV. \n\nMy reason why exploration in early to mid 20s is key is two fold. First, most people have not figured out who they are until they are in their late 20s, at least. I was well spoken, getting ready to go to law school, and a very capable debater in my early 20s. I would have staunchly written here that I knew exactly who I was. And, I would have genuinely believed that at the time. But, I was wrong. It really was not until a few serious relationships in my mid-late 20s not working out that I learned who I was and, most importantly, what I was looking for in a life partner. I valued the wrong things in my early 20s and I had immature relationship tendencies that are common of many men at that age. For example, did you try to convince your ex with the same rationale you wrote here? If so, i would say that was an immature response. \n\nSecond, which is particularly applicable to someone like you that spent 18-22 in a relationship, is that you are not yet capable or comfortable being alone. If you are not comfortable just being alone, then you will not be prepared to do the hard work of waiting for the right relationship. You should be looking for the “right thing” in the next few years not just the “next thing.” \n\nIt was not until I was 27 that I realized I had filled all of the voids with meaningless relationships and that I was truly afraid of being alone. My 16-20\nYear old relationship was one of pure comfort. We were familiar with each other and we got along so well stayed together. I spent 6 months without dating at all. No apps, no hook ups, just me. I took some trips alone, read more books, focused on my career more. I realized that I was okay alone and a partner was someone that could supplement my already incredible life and my happiness did not depend on the presence of another person. \n\nA few months after re entering the dating scene, I met my wife. \n\nMaybe you will meet your wife next month, I don’t know. My advice to you would be to accept that you may not know it all and maybe, just maybe, the majority of people giving you identical advice have learned a thing or two in life that you have yet to experience. \n\nBook a trip with some friends, go back packing for a few weeks, hiking, go to Europe and stay in a hostels. Focus on yourself and what makes you happy. You seem to have a strong moral compass. If you are honest and a good man while you are exploring, there is no reason you cannot do date around ethically.",

    "selftext": "In modern culture, even a polite or well-intentioned flirtatious gesture from a man can carry real social risk. The language around romance has become entangled with the language of power, framing nearly every interaction through the lens of imbalance or potential harm. This framing, while born from valid concerns about consent and safety, has also created an atmosphere of suspicion where nuance and intent are often lost. Digital communication amplifies this tension, messages are overanalyzed, intentions scrutinized. Many retreat into irony or detachment, but beneath it all lies a shared confusion: everyone craves connection, yet few feel safe making the first move.\n\nA simple compliment, a moment of chemistry, or an attempt to connect in person can easily framed as inappropriate, not because it is, but because the cultural script now defaults to caution and moral judgment. As a result, any courtship outside, the controlled distance of dating apps, feels highly disincentivised.",

Which is a *massive* advance in the quality of our society.\n\nLike, do you really think that so many more women in the past actually liked all the cringe-y \"chivalrous\" BS men used to do and for which they expected to be showered with praise?\n\nOr do you think that maybe a lot of them just put up with it because they weren't allowed to live independently, so either they put up with the least gross dude they could find within a certain time span or they ended up on the street?\n\nThe women who lived back then worked pretty hard to change a lot of these attitudes and build power for themselves and their descendants. Do you really think they would have done that if they were perfectly fine with the way they were being treated?\n\nNow, I think I can understand and sympathize with the root cause of the issue you're talking about -- that is, society does a very poor job of teaching social skills to men, and while some men are able to figure it out on their own there are many men who are never taught and don't know how to learn what they need to learn in order to get what they expect to get in the world. That is indeed a thing, and it sucks. And us dudes need to do a better job taking care of and helping each other, the way women have taken care of and helped each other in the course of feminism.\n\nBut there is no acceptable outcome to this that allows men to continue to be socially inept and often kind of gross while simply forcing women to endure that even when they don't want to. It is good that women have the ability to say no to dudes they don't like.\n\nAnd if a guy regularly gets told he is being threatening when he tries to flirt, I *guarantee* that is a matter of him not knowing how to behave, not something wrong with society.\n\nI have some thoughts on mistakes some of these guys often make that might help, but it has to start with the guy wanting to improve himself rather than wallow in grievance and complain that society should just force women to accept whatever weak shit he is throwing out there without even trying.",

        "body": "The high risks you speak of in your examples are pitiful compared to the risk of being a woman in public. \n\n\nI was first followed around by an older man in grade 5 at a school pool adventure. In my experience dating, men regularly jump into choking without consent during the first sexual encounter, which comes with extreme risks of stroke and brain damage. Sometimes they'll do it even after I've already said it's a hard boundary and I'm absolutely against being choked. \n\n\nA guy not feeling comfortable going to his favorite coffee shop because he gave the barista his number and she found it uncomfortable isn't at high risk. He's mildly inconvenienced.\n\n\nThe social stigma also isn't as severe as you speak of. Here's a true example, a friend of mine, who I'm still friends with despite this, asked me out multiple times when we first met. He would not stop begging to go out and also made uncomfortable sexual advances including sharing a dick pic. I had to shut him down hard and I definitely did tell people he made me uncomfortable. Other people had concerns too, including someone in a fucked up situation that he offered to stay with him and her feeling pressured to repay him with sex, something he explicitly requested. She moved out shortly afterwards. \n\n\nBut we were all a part of the same community and ya know what happened? He didn't get exiled and he was still able to hit on women, sometimes even in uncomfortable ways. People definitely did talk about his creepy behavior, another man talked to him about taking no for an answer the first time, but no one labeled him as a predator because it's clear he wasn't outright trying to rape people, just really desperate and being super uncomfortable. He grew from it, and aside from the person who lived with him who does not have a friendship with him anymore, he is still accepted in the community. \n\n\nHe even told me about getting together with another woman who goes there. So he clearly was not completely shut down and unable to make any romantic/sexual connections. \n\n\nThis sort of ending is often the outcome of men's creepy behavior being spoken about in communities. Some women will avoid him, some men might speak up with advice for him to be less demanding once rejected, and overall mostly the community goes on how it did, including him. Most communities won't exile someone or get deeply involved unless severe violence is present. And even then, sexual violence is often downplayed rather than punishing a violator. \n\n\nOn the flip end let's talk about the severe risks to women while dating. If she doesn't know him well there's a risk he will harm her and no one will take it seriously because she put herself in that situation. If she refuses to meet alone, or has a high bar for her safety, she's called a prude or a bitch. If she is raped, it's more likely it won't be reported and the rapists life won't even be impacted. Only 31% of rapes are reported according to the department of justice. \n\n\nI haven't had a year of my life I haven't been followed, cat called, violently harassed or someone attempted to coerce me into sex I didn't want to have. A man choked my ex gf at a college party because he figured she wanted it because she was drunk. This is a lesbian who repeatedly denied his advances and ya know what the school did? Nothing. Ya know what repercussions he faced? Absolutely nothing. And let me remind you that even consensual choking has a high risk level for stoke and brain damage.\n\n\nAt least 1 in 3 women have experienced rape. How many men have been completely shattered by false accusations, which legally only happened less than 1% of the time? \n\n\nIt is disingenuous to call a man not being able to get coffee from a favorite spot high risk.  (Especially disingenuous because his exile is likely self imposed and not a business actually refusing him service, as most service industry's policy around sexual violence is that it requires active touching and a violation that is reported to the police. Straight up violent verbal sexual harassment is dismissed more often than not in kitchens. Harassment is experienced by over 90% of women working in restaurants. Here's a source with more information:\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/01/sexual-harassment-is-pervasive-in-the-restaurant-industry-heres-what-needs-to-change) \n\n\nTo compare men's high risk situation of being called creepy in dating to womens high risk of violence shows that it is absolutely tone deaf and ridiculous to call mens experience with dating high risk. It absolutely pales in comparison to women's risks in dating which includes actual high levels of risk of violence, coercion and rape. \n\n\nIt also is not as dramatic or life changing to be labeled a creep as you assert. Most men called creeps are not impacted at all by it, and the ones that are usually just get less opportunities to hit on women. Very few men are losing all their friends, their job or their home over asking someone out. Even the very few who are falsely accused (less than 1%) are not going to face serious loss in these departments. There is little to no threat to their livelihoods or life itself. It is not high risk. \n\n\nThe same cannot be said of women, who do risk their life to date, and who all take precautions explicitly because any harm that comes to them will likely be blamed on them by society. \n\n\nIt is wrong to call these experiences high risk for men. By comparison to women's experiences dating, these risks of being seen as creepy are barely life impacting.",

This is because we are more aware of that power and how it has been historically gendered, physically and socially more dangerous for women, and we have increased our education, research, and communication about the problems inherent in pas assumptions/norms.\n\nIt used to be the norm to transgress women’s boundaries (even resenting that they may exist) in an effort to gain sexual access. Trapping women against walls, stalking, and even physical abuse were portrayed as ‘sexy’ or ‘romantic.’ Men (and fewer women) would skip the ‘consent’ stage and spy on women, trick them, bully them, or otherwise try to expedite the courting process. In many societies, consent was explicitly denied women (and some men). Prom night pressure, ‘virginity’ narratives (for both women and men), and endless media all undermined consent for all parties involved.\n\nNow there is not a human being in the developed world who can claim they have never heard how bad these things are. Feminism, social science, various faiths, laws, and norms have all improved our understanding of the value of consent. \n\nMy hope is that by moving the consent requirement all the way to the first interactions and empowering people to set boundaries, the crippling fear of (and often violent response to) imposed on men of rejection that makes us so brittle and dangerous will lessen too. \n\nStrength is acknowledging boundaries, not feeling entitled, and requiring enthusiastic consent.

It really just seems like you are overthinking this and that you and several commenters are honing in on a few examples of women who have ruined men’s lives and reputation and treating those awful cases like a worrying trend which is false.",

        "body": "The problem you discuss re: the language of power imbalance and coercion, while real and existing, I think is overstated. I think it's more of a niche issue that is both overrepresented in digital media (as compared with how dating and flirting happens in real life) and also concerns a moral panic the worst of which we have already seen come and go. I think 5-10 years ago that was a bigger problem than it is today.\n\nI would argue that the bigger issue is the lack of social integration among people of dating age. People socialize online instead of in real life. People have fewer friends. And this had many impacts. One is that young people are more socially awkward and anxious than any generation preceding them, which genuinely does make dating and flirting (or being flirted with) more risky and uncomfortable than it once was. Another is that people are less often members of mixed-gender social groups of people of a similar age. This does more than merely open people up to more potential partners to whom one already has some sort of a connection, and can thereby be a safer environment within which to explore dating (because let's be real hitting on your friends can still be awkward and uncomfortable). It also means that there are today fewer instances of being connected to potential partners through the \"friend of a friend\" route. Because in situations that arise from these social contexts, dating and flirting carry drastically different risk/reward profiles. For a woman, even a tangential familiarity with a young man, some awareness of his reputation, and the knowledge that he is incentivized to maintain a certain reputation of conduct can go a long way in establishing a degree of security w/r/t to prospect of dating. And conversely, for young men, good standing within a context of preexisting social ties and mutual connections can help ensure a level of good faith insofar as he is concerned about his words or actions being poorly received.\n\nLong story short: I think you drastically underemphasize what I would argue is the chief cause of the problem you cite. In addition to being legitimately worse at flirting, signaling and dating (through no fault of their own) young people are extremely isolated and atomized. Cold approaches genuinely are becoming more of the past because people are walking around with their faces in their phones, earbuds in their ears, and deeply uncomfortable in real-time face-to-face interaction with strangers. But there's also the issue surrounding the fact that the social scripts we have inherited around dating assume a social infrastructure that no longer exists. Nowadays, when a man approaches a woman, they are each in a tangible sense much more on islands than in a previous world wherein there was an integrated social fabric in which they were both embedded. And this changes everything. You'll be more smooth (and thereby less threatening) in an environment like that because it will have happened tons of times. For reasons of maintaining their own reputations, women will be incentivized to be thoughtful and compassionate in their rejections. Dates won't be all or nothing. Maybe it doesn't work out but maybe through word of mouth you've made yourself available to or more attractive to other potential partners.\n\nAside from the above, there's also the inundation of horrific online content telling men and women to hate each other. Can't go without mentioning that.\n\nIt may seem as though I've neglected to address the gender imbalance surrounding this. I'd say that this element mainly stems from two sources. One of them being the traditional expectation that men initiate, which, though it carries certain privileges, is for reasons discussed above arguably more of a burden than it ever has been before. The other being the fact that, for whatever reasons, men do seem to be less socially oriented and prone to isolation than women, which would cause this to hit them especially hard.\n\nAnyway, I believe that certain structural forces and their impact on our social life are far more significant than the discourse you've described. I would say that discourse is relatively niche and is already falling out of fashion to a noticeable degree.",

If you had that kind of technology then all other motivation for the characters makes no sense at all.  \n\nTruly the downfall of so many potentially good movies is just how little effort goes into the writing vs the known actors and special effects.

Sorry to get on my soap box here, but who is Variety writing these articles for and why are they rooting for the failure of the industry they primarily work? Does anybody remember the articles that came out immediately after Sinners crushed week 1? Oh I remember, they're writing them for the studios that are trying to claw back power after PTA, Coogler, Creggers and others have killed this year as Directors have asked for more autonomy.\n\nThis article is straight up bullshit. They're using the term \"projecting\" as if it's done making money. They're also claiming that WB 2025 slate doesn't \"offset\" the losses of a movie in it's 3rd week of release, when Warner has done $4B at the box office this year. That's a \"B\"... do they not know the difference between a billion and a million? Using their same logic regarding OBAA's ticket sales, that would mean $2B in ticket revenue...\n\nTell me with a straight face that WB isn't absolutely ecstatic with the business OBAA has done. There are zero movies I can think of in the last 3 years that have gotten the across the board adoration this has. Not Oppenheimer, not Dune. You probably have to go all the way back to Parasite.\n\nThey spent $70mm on promotion per Variety... does the critical mass not count?  I'm so tired of this.

I wanted a bigger mystery. But once its established immediately that the premise is ACTUALLY different from what the trailers were presenting, I kinda just kept waiting for the big moment, the deep dark reveal, and instead we got a weird dream sequence with the floating rifle and then the whole entire mystery is revealed via flashback and its just too obvious and boring for me that \"oh. the kid that didnt get kidnapped, maybe he actually had more to do with it\"!<\n\nthat was just unrealistic to me. \n\nyes, the movie is so well made and executed well visually overall. >!I would have just changed the story and fully commit to the \"ALL children from a single class go missing\"!<\n\nOverall the movie was *good* it just wasnt great for me.

        "body": "Shoot, it's been a month already? F*ck. Then let me get this off my chest.  \n\nMy problem with Borderlands games (and really, with all loot-driven games) is that once I'm to the point where most of my gear is great - meaning I've won the RNG lottery enough times that I'm basically just wearing one big amalgamated jackpot - the odds of finding new gear worth equipping goes <0.1%, and the fun-factor plateaus *insufferably*. My \"power fantasy\" becomes a \"power reality,\" and whatever build I've got going by then all but stops evolving, and instead progress just becomes about incremental refinement and occasional adaptation to in-game stressors. And I'm not talking about trying to make high-level end-game builds. I'm talking about like what usually happens right around level 30-40 in most games.\n\nFrom this point, try as I might to get my money's worth, my interest can last only so many gameplay loops. I eventually, *inexorably*, realize my build is no longer cutting it, fighting is becoming truly tedious, and now instead of feeling giddy to find loot for loot's sake, and instead of getting to experiment with a bunch of wildly different but basically equivalent equippables, I'm just mindlessly clawing open chest after chest after chest, popping hordes of bubble-wrap-like enemies, numb to everything that is supposed to be fun while I hope - with steadily depleting reserves of immersible energy - to win yet another lottery just so I can find whatever it is I need to get back to being able to *enjoy* the game again.  \n\nEven when I do, though, if I do, it's usually too little late for me. The honeymoon has ended, I'm completely out of love with the core gameplay loop, and more likely than not I've already begun cheating on the game with some other sexier, more hand-crafted, less repetitive game.\n\nIt's why I can never seem to make it past like 50% of the campaign on my first try, and why I much prefer to just start multiple new games with each of the different character classes, and get the ones I like best to their plateau-points. Seeing any single character through to their end-game builds just ... isn't worth the like 80-20 ratio of brainless repetition to genuine pleasure for me.\n\nEDIT: Paragraph breaks.",

They'll deflect as much as they can because that's what trolls have always done (very deliberately, often laughing at you in private while they do it), and the GOP is now just run by racist trolls and their rich benefactors (who are themselves just rich racist trolls in many cases).\n\nOf course, you can also tie this all the way back to Reagan, Nixon's racist views, and to the southern strategy even before that... this is just the latest, edgiest form of this nonsense, normalized by the democratization of speech technology and social media.

It's easy for Republicans to deny actual historical events and downplay horrific historical events; they practice this every day when they ignore the countless lies they are told in order to toe the party line. Change what people think about history, then sell them the idea that all of the horrors that happened in the past not only *didn't* happen, but it is something that they should *want* for their own future.\n\nIt's the same reason why actual historians and people with two brain cells to rub together have been listening to Trump's rhetoric & reading the things he has been posting the last decade, and been warning anyone who would listen that we were heading towards authoritarianism. And, here it is. This is no longer \"we're heading toward the cliff\", we're going down it now, to the delight of a shockingly large percentage of the country.",

And if you *do* read them, he wants you to think they’re just “kids” saying “edgy, offensive” things.  \n...  \nOne problem with this defense? The people in the group chat aren’t “kids.” By scanning public records and media reports, *Mother Jones* determined the ages of eight of the 11 participants in the chat: They appear to range from 24 to 35.  \n...  \nHendrix, the Kansas Young Republicans vice chair, and Luke Mosiman, chair of the Arizona Young Republicans, were, at 24, the youngest participants in the chat whose ages *Mother Jones* could determine through public reporting and records. *Politico* reported Hendrix used variations of a racial slur more than a dozen times in the chat.  \n...  \nThe oldest appears to be Joe Maligno, who public records suggest is 35. In the chat, he spoke about gas chambers and used a racial slur toward Chinese people. Maligno previously identified himself as general counsel for the New York State Young Republicans. Maligno did not respond to requests for comment from *Politico*. According to a Wednesday follow-up report from the outlet, he lost his job as an employee of the New York State Unified Court System.\n\n>A handful of other participants seem to fall in the middle of that age range. According to public records, Annie Kaykaty, New York’s national committee member who, in response to Maligno’s comment about gas chambers, said, “I’m ready to watch people burn now,” is 28. Alex Dwyer, chair of the Kansas Young Republicans, who wrote a series of numbers used by white supremacists and wrote, “Sex is gay,” is 29; Peter Giunta, former chair of the New York State Young Republicans, who referred to Black people as “watermelon people” and “monkeys” and said, at another point, “I love Hitler,” is 31.",

I had 3 cousins tell me to screenshot something from their instagrams. I didn’t respond. \n\nI sent a text out the day before I put in the order saying anybody that did not send a picture of themselves in the next 24 hours would be replaced by pictures of my dog. \n\nThe same 3 cousins never sent pictures. Their spots have my dog in a sombrero, my dog at the pumpkin patch, and my dog in a chicken costume. \n\nThey came over for my grandpas birthday and saw him open his new phone case. They saw that their pictures weren’t on the case and got mad at me for not picking something off their instagrams like they told me to. I said that I sent 3 reminders to send me a picture with a clear warning that anybody that did not send a picture would be replaced with a picture of the dog. They knew exactly what would happen. \n\nMy grandpa finds it hilarious but their parents are telling my parents that I kept them off the phone case on purpose and they want me to apologize. \n\nAITA for replacing them with pictures of my dog because they never sent me a picture?",

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything.***\n\nMy grandpas birthday was a couple weeks ago. 6 weeks before his birthday, I texted all of my siblings and cousins (there’s 9 of us) and told them to send me a picture of themselves within the next 4 weeks so I could put it on a phone case for our grandpa’s birthday. \n\n2 weeks later I sent the text again, saying I needed a picture of them and anybody that chooses not to send a picture will be replaced by a picture of my dog. I had 3 cousins tell me to screenshot something from their instagrams. I didn’t respond. \n\nI sent a text out the day before I put in the order saying anybody that did not send a picture of themselves in the next 24 hours would be replaced by pictures of my dog. \n\nThe same 3 cousins never sent pictures. Their spots have my dog in a sombrero, my dog at the pumpkin patch, and my dog in a chicken costume. \n\nThey came over for my grandpas birthday and saw him open his new phone case. They saw that their pictures weren’t on the case and got mad at me for not picking something off their instagrams like they told me to. I said that I sent 3 reminders to send me a picture with a clear warning that anybody that did not send a picture would be replaced with a picture of the dog. They knew exactly what would happen. \n\nMy grandpa finds it hilarious but their parents are telling my parents that I kept them off the phone case on purpose and they want me to apologize. \n\nAITA for replacing them with pictures of my dog because they never sent me a picture?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

    "title": "AITA For Asking Why My Co-Worker Wears Makeup Everyday?",
    "selftext": "Howdy howdy, never posted here, throwaway account, yadda yadda yadda.\n\nSo I (29M) was at work during a pretty long meeting with a few other co-workers. One of my co-workers is new (late 30s F) and the conversation steered around our professional experiences and history. Pretty standard I guess.\n\nMidway during reviewing some boring stuff this co-worker asked me with a smirk, « Can I ask you a question ? ». Since we were talking about our professional lives I was like « yeah sure what’s up? », and she followed up with why do you always wear hats?\n\nNow, I’ll be honest I’m bald, however I like my baldness. I started balding at 21 and I was like, fuck that, and just shaved it off instead of trying to style my hair in anyway to hide it. Also since my hair is super curly and compact it just wasn’t gonna be an option. In college people loved it, said I had a good head shape and said I looked like Terry Crews, Shaquille O’Neal or The Rock (not sure about that last one lol) so I was pretty confident with it.\n\nBut when I turned 25 I started being mistaken for 30 cause of the bald cut so I started wearing hats pretty much everywhere. Grew a collection for all situations, work, gym, social life. Anywhere besides weddings and funerals tbh. And with hats on at 29 I’ve been mistaken to be as young as 22 (not the goal but yeah). The plan was to wear them until 30 and then cut back when my head matched my age lol\n\nAnyways, this co-worker asks « why do you wear hats everyday? » to be fair it’s a corporate setting but it’s also tech, we’re in marketing and it’s 2025 so smart-casual is the rule of thumb and my bosses don’t care and dress in hoodies and hats to work some days.\n\nI responded « I like hats » and she said « but everyday? », so I said « yeah I’m bald, I like my headshape but I don’t wanna look like I’m 35 so I’ll wear hats for now, plus I look good in them! ». Now I wasn’t thinking and she’s probably around this 35 age or older so I may have offended her with that but she replied « 29 and wearing hats everyday to hide? Wow »\n\nThis truck a nerve with me so I responded « Well since joining I’ve seen you wear makeup everyday, even casual Fridays or on your work from home team calls, so why do YOU wear makeup everyday? » there was a muffled giggle but it’s clear the atmosphere was tense.\n\nShe got heated and said « that’s a sexist question » and I said « How? Other women in the office don’t wear makeup everyday and my boyfriend sometimes wears makeup when we go out to a high class event. He just doesn’t do it everyday. So why do you wear makeup everyday? »\n\nShe got heated and silent and one of the other co-workers went back to focusing on the deck. I feel like her and I not on the best of terms now as she will not talk to me now.\n\nSo, AITA for asking why my co-worker wears makeup everyday?",

    "title": "AITA for reminding my mom that my son is a child?",
    "selftext": "My son was sick yesterday, and my mom offered to babysit for me since I couldn't miss work. For context, I(30F) am a single mom because my husband passed away in an accident last year. We had 2 kids together, ages 12 and 8, and my 8 years have severe ADHD and Autism. \n\nBeing a newly single mom money has been really tight and I do get state assistance but not a lot and my husband didn't have life insurance so there was no money left to us from him.My mom and sister help me the with babysitting if the kids are sick or if there is no school cause I can't afford a sitter.\n\nThe issues came when I told her I didn't have food to spare right now cause I haven't been able to go shopping yet and to please bring her own food or be prepped to have to have to buy herself food cause the food I have in the house is strictly for the kids till I can get to the store this weekend(We were all super sick last weekend and I don't live in a town with a grocery store and the closest one is a 30 minute drive). She said it would be easier to take my son to her house then which i was okay with, but 8 year old hates going to her house.\n\nWhen she comes to get him, he has a meltdown because he doesn't want to go to her house. I ask if she can just stay, and I can find a way to get more food before the weekend. She said no and insisted he had to come with her, and that made it worse. Now my mom has not had great patience, but her and my sister are the only sitters I have right now cause they don't charge me much, just the gas to get here.\n\nWell she lost it and started yelling at me and him that she didn't have time for this and she had plans that day she canceled just to watch him(she didn't mention this to me when I asked). She also said I quote \"I wish we could trade lives and I could lay around and throw tantrums all day and you can go to work and just have everyone use you and take your money all the time. How much it must suck to be you and do whatever you want while i have to do nothing but take care of other people. \" I never borrow money from my mother but my sister and grandma live with her and they dont work so I know she is under a lot of stress and she takes it out on me a lot(calling me burden. Letting me know how much my tragic loss has effected her negatively. Calling me other names or yelling at me for things my sister or grandma do) \n\n I didn't yell or argue. I simply covered his ears and looked at her and went, \"Mom, he is 8\". She lost it and screamed, \"F*** you then, miss work and lose money I don't care, I am leaving,\" and then she left. Now she says she will not babysit for me again so I can know true struggle, which if she follows through means I have to miss a bunch of work or find a sitter I can trust that won't break my bank. So I am wondering should I have cut her a break knowing she is under so much pressure and I understand she is frustrated and needs to get it off her chest but I feel like verbal punching bag and I dont want my kids to have to deal with that as well. Aita?\n\n\nUpdate: My mom is banned from my place of work, and I will no longer be speaking to her, my grandma, and will be limiting contact with my sister. I was sent home early due to my emotional state. They showed up before my lunch break and demanded to talk to me, and when my boss said no, my mom lost it and started screaming at her so loudly I could hear down the hall from my classroom. She sent another staff member to get me to try to defuse the situation but my mom only started screaming at me that I wasted her time and her gas because she was going to have to wait around all day for me(I told her I go to lunch at 12:15pm everyday and she showed at 10:30am) while calking me all sorts of names and cussing with every other word. I asked if we could go out side to talk and she said that she no longer wants to talk to me and that she just came because my sister asked to her(I didn't know this my sister made it seem like it was mom's idea on the phone). One of my coworkers is going to be retiring a week before Thanksgiving and told me she will watch my kids during school breaks after she retires for the same price I paid my mom after everyone got see what my mother was like in person.  She said she doesnt feel right having me keep her as a sitter after her behavior today and she understands how hard being a widow is(She lost her husband when her kids were 10 and 14 but I had no idea until today since she never shared much about her personal life). We ended up having to talk to the police on my mother because she was refusing to leave, and they came and escorted her off the property. After they left my sister called me to tell me my mom blocked me on everything and told her she no longer has 2 daughters just one and that my sister is forbidden from coming to see me or watching the kids while she lives with our mother. Luckily, she will be moving in with her fiance after he gets back from deployment. Thank you for all the advice I did apply online to social security but received an automated email response saying due to the federal shut down the local office is closed they will check my application as soon as someone returns to the office. \n\nAlso, in case anyone wonders, my coworkers knew childcare was a struggle for me but didn't have any advice to help me with childcare because most of them dont have kids, pr their kids are already grown. But the lady who offered to help is one of my favorite coworkers and she has come over to help me make decorations for our classrooms at work so she knows my kids and they really seemed to like her whenever she came by to work on work things and I know she is fully certified and train to care for a special needs child as everyone at my place of employment is.

I know it must be very hard for you and I'm sorry for your loss, but honestly, a few nights of peanut butter sandwiches for dinner would be better than having the stress on both of you of having to deal with this. \n\nSounds like you need space and boundaries. It is absolutely NOT okay for her to take out her frustrations on you like this, nor scream at him like that. \n\nSome things that helped me with my son are:\n\n1. Make your home your safe place. Limit who comes in and how often they stay. Let him know that home is his sanctuary where he can be safe and be himself (not mask). Within home, let him know his room (if he has his own) is HIS space and if he needs time to himself, you will respect that and let him go hang out there if he is feeling overwhelmed or needs time out to recharge. If people visit, they don't get to go into his space. There is no reason for them to be in there and they can interact with him in the family areas. His space is his own, though obviously, while you can be respectful of his space, he needs to accept that you will need to enter it but you won't move/rearrange his stuff without talking to him first, etc). \n\n2. If you are going out, especially somewhere difficult for your son, limit the time you spend there. Try to give clear guidelines for how long you are going to stay, but be prepared to leave earlier if need be. If visiting, prepare to intercept and draw attention away from your child if he is becoming overwhelmed. Give him things he can distract himself with (fidget toys, books, games, etc) and give him time away, if possible (e.g. he can sit in the car for a few minutes, maybe under the guise of fetching something for you, just to give him a break away) and try to end these interactions with something positive to him. E.g. \"you've done really well. If you want to, when you get home, you can have time to do X activity that you really like.\"). When my son was younger, that may be watching TV or playing video games, but now it tends to be more \"you have X time to disappear to your room and not be called on or disturbed (e.g. with my son, it might be \"You survived a whole morning visiting family, you can now disappear for the rest of the afternoon, but after 5pm, I need you to come help out with your normal chores (like emptying the dishwasher etc).\")\n\nOnce my son knew that he had a safe place, I would limit time spent in overwhelming places, and not leave him alone with people who overwhelmed him, he calmed down a lot. He was better able to communicate (not always verbally, but in whatever way he felt comfortable with at the time) when he was struggling and it massively helped him learn emotional regulation. \n\nAlso, foreshadow everything as best you can. NO SURPRISES. EVER. My son is in college now, and he still absolutely freaks out if I spring things on him. Even things I know he is going to be resistant to and struggle with coping are much better when he knows about them in advance. Yes, he can stress leading up to these events, but it is a far lesser evil than being unprepared and overwhelmed by the unexpected. \n\nGood luck!",

I want him to be a kid as long as he can and its not fair to expect him to take care of his disabled brother especially if one or both are sick \n\nI live in a small 2 bedroom apartment and I do r have room for my sister and I can't afford her to move it cause that will raise the bills and cost food. She refuses to work because she doesnt want to and I can't have the state pay her for babysitting cause she has no certifications and she doesnt have a high school diploma or GD. \n\nMy son is in school and has a para because he is flight risk not because he violent, though we've had some violent outbursts after his father passed away but he doesnt know how to properly process this loss and most kids dont so I dont know why everyone acts like he should get over it. He struggled with voilent tendencies when he was small hut he has been in the need therapys since he was 4. \n\nMy mom has never spoken or acted that way around him before to my knowledge or I wouldn't have her watch him. \n\nI didn't know about SSI and I will look into but yall gotta stop being rude about it. I haven't had someone this close to me die before and I am just turned 30. I had no idea any of this was a thing because no one told me before now. I never looked into myself because I didn't know there was anything to look it. Yall just be rude to be rude. \n\nMy inlaws won't return my calls or texts but I'm giving them their space as they just lost their child/brother too. Seeing me and the kids might be too hard on them and I respect how they feel the need to grieve their loss.\n\nI pay my mom. I don't know how people keep missing that but she is not a free sitter. I pay her 40$ everytime which is more than the daily fee at the local daycare. I wouldn't expect them to watch my kids for free just because they are family and family wouldn't watch them for free anyway and they've made that very very clear to me. \n\nI can handle my mom taking her anger and stress out on me privately but I draw the line at her taking it out on my kids. She has a right to feel stressed and upset and I understand that but I also have that right.

He was I'll and it was contagious as we had all been sick all weekend except him he didn't get sick till Tuesday. \n2.

Your 8yo might qualify for disability benefits, which would give you access to resources to help with his education and even very affordable sitters. Good luck, op. You got this. Nta.",

When an adult is emotionally immature, they tend to make crises about themselves, struggle with empathy when stressed, and lash out when they feel burdened or trapped. \n\nStrategies that have helped me with family members who are like this: \n\n1. Don’t argue facts, reflect feelings. You might say: “I can tell you’re feeling really overwhelmed and unappreciated right now.” \n\n2. Set firm but simple boundaries. “I understand if you can’t babysit right now. I need calm care for the kids, so I’ll make other arrangements.”\n\n3. Don’t seek nurturing where it can’t be given. She isn’t capable of seeing where you are struggling when she is struggling. \n\n4. Use I statements; they are less triggering. Acknowledge her sacrifice, even if you don’t agree with her. Validate her feelings without taking blame: “I hear that this feels really overwhelming for you. I don’t want you to feel unappreciated. I’m grateful for the times you’ve stepped in.”\n\n\nIf you want her to continue babysitting, you’re going have to extend the olive branch first. “Mom, I know the other day was hard for both of us. I don’t want things to be tense between us, because I really appreciate the way you’ve helped with the kids. I also need to keep things calmer for [child’s name] when he’s upset. Can we find a way to make it easier next time? Maybe if I set snacks aside here, you won’t have to worry about food, and I’ll keep him ready so transitions go smoother.”\n\nAs a fellow single parent of an ASD/ADHD kid with a deceased coparent…sometimes you gotta take the L to get what you need for the kids. Do you have social security survivor benefits for the kids? Do you had developmental disability services through your county/state? I tapped into every government and community based assistance I could get until I was able to support us myself. County can offer services like respite care.",

    "selftext": "My ex and I have a 12 year old daughter, Olivia, with autism level 2. My ex has primary custody and I have Olivia on Wednesdays and every other weekend. \n\nA few months ago my ex told me she was feeling a little burnt out so she wanted us to keep Olivia from Wednesday to Sunday so she could go on a trip with some friends. Olivia is very attached to her mom, so my ex told Olivia that it was a work trip and she had to go. \n\nLast week one of my ex’s friends was at the house with my ex and Olivia and their vacation somehow came up. Olivia figured out that the vacation was the “work trip” that her mom told her about and freaked out because her mom lied to her and her mom doesn’t lie. \n\nShe hid in her room for the rest of the day, then called me and asked me to come get her. She’s been with us ever since. \n\nShe’s really upset about this. She cries all the time because she wants her mom but she doesn’t know what else her mom lied about and she doesn’t trust her. \n\nApparently Olivia’s aide called my ex because she’s been having a hard time in school so now my ex wife is demanding that I send Olivia home so they can get back to her routines and start working with her therapist to help her get over this but I told her Olivia will go back when she’s ready. Now she’s threatening to call the police and/or take me back to court over “custodial interference” even though we’ve always had a very friendly co parenting relationship. \n\nMy wife thinks we should send her back to avoid drama but I think it should be Olivia’s choice. AITA for refusing to send her back after she found out her mom lied to her?",

    "selftext": "My husband and I both started our own businesses 20 years ago. They were moderately successful in that, we weren’t rich, but our financial needs have always been met up until the last 5 years. My husband’s business is what most would consider a luxury service. When “times are tough”, people do without said service. My husband tried several things to keep his business afloat, including taking out some loans and made some bad investments that have left us in not the best financial state. At this point, it costs more to operate his business than he is profiting from it. The writing has been on the wall the past several months, and he’s finally agreed it’s time to close the doors.\n\nNow, I totally understand that this is something that is upsetting to him. This business was his dream and you can’t just let go of that mentally in a snap, especially not after 20 years. I have been very supportive and let him vent. I have encouraged him to go to therapy, though he has turned me down. I want to be as sensitive as possible. I wish my business were enough to keep us afloat until he was ready to figure out what he wanted to do next. Unfortunately, with all the bills we have, we can’t afford for him to sit around and not do anything. Neither of us went to college, which does mean his options are limited. Going back to school isn’t financially possible right now, nor does he want to do that. He’d have to have a boss, potentially work weekends and weird hours, all the things you get to avoid when you have your own business of 20 years. I get why this isn’t appealing to him, but unfortunately, it’s what he has to do.\n\nMy husband has really pushed back on getting a new job. I’ve tried to be as sympathetic as possible, but again, we can’t afford for him to sit home all day. We’ve talked about it, several times. I show sympathy and empathy. I, again, tell him to seek therapy. It always ends in an argument where I am told I am being unreasonable.\n\nThe other day, my sister-in-law (his brother’s wife) came over to talk to me. She spoke to me as if I were 5 years old and said I needed to give him a break. She said that I cannot expect him to go back to having a boss after 20 years. She suggested that I get a second job. With the hours I work, I’d never get to see my kids or husband at that point. I said I’m not going to do that. If my business went under, of course I’d go and get a different job, but it is unreasonable for everyone to expect me to work all these hours while my husband does nothing (his help with the housework and the kids has dropped since he had to close the business, so I doubt me working would change that, so I’d be working 7 days a week, plus all that.) My sister-in-law just kept telling me that this is a sacrifice I should be making and that I am being unreasonable. Everyone else seems to agree, including my husband. I feel insane. Am I the asshole for not wanting to get a second job and expecting him to get one?",

    "selftext": "I (female 30yrs) and my husband ( male 32 yrs) have been married for four years and have a son, soon turning one. We are really close with my husband's older brother, he is really cool and we love hanging out with him. However, I have never really gotten along with his younger brother (let's call him Mark) because, among many other reasons, he has a tendency of putting out racist, sexist or otherwise inappropriate comments. Dare to say, our values and morals simply don't align but over the years I have learnt to bite my tongue and ignore the comments and to act civil around him in family gatherings. \n\nThings have however changed since having a child, as I do not want him to be exposed to this kind of racist talk, especially from an uncle who should act as a role model to our son. I talked to my husband about this issue and asked him to have a discussion with Mark that we do not allow this kind of talk around our child, as we want to raise him to respect people with different ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations etc. My husband agreed and promised to talk to Mark about it, or at the very least, intervene if Mark does this ever again in the presence of our son. \n\nA few days ago we went over to my in-laws' house for their wedding anniversary dinner. Everyone was having a great time up until Mark had had a couple of glasses of wine and begun with his racist slurring yet again (I'll spare you from the details, but let me tell you, it was bad!). I looked over to my husband, expecting him to do or say something but he did nothing, just sipped his wine in silence. I felt this sudden rage and couldn't hold it in any longer and angrily hissed at Mark something along the lines of \"Will you shut the f\\*\\*\\* up if you have nothing smarter to say?!\". The whole room went dead silent and you could cut the atmosphere with a knife, it was so awkward for everyone. We finished our meal quickly and went home as soon as we could, me still boiling inside from anger over the whole situation and how my husband didn't stand up to me against his brother. \n\nYesterday my husband received an angry text from my mother-in-law, stating I had ruined their anniversary dinner my lashing out at Mark at the table like that. I understand her being upset since the dinner was to celebrate their marriage and the conflict ruined the mood for everyone and now there is this bid drama in the family over what happened. I agree that the timing was not great and that I could have rephrased myself in a more constructive way but at the same time, I could not take it anymore and felt I had to put a stop to it once and for all. So am I the asshole?\n\nP.S English is not my first language, so please forgive me if the grammar isn't always a 100%. \n\n",

    "selftext": "I’m 25M, disabled, and I have a valid disabled parking permit. I drive an older BMW, a nice one (imo).\n\nAfter my physiotherapy, I walked back to my car, parked in a disabled parking spot. I got in and spent a few minutes on my phone before heading home. Just taking a short breath, i always do that after physio.\n\nThe parking lot was nearly empty. Next to me were three regular open spots, and across from me there was another empty disabled spot with two free spaces beside it. And it’s a free parking area, by the way.\n\nThen a woman, somehere mid-60s, drives up. She stares at me for a few seconds, then parks her car half almost crisscross across the disabled spot opposite me. She gets out, walks straight up to my window, and says: “Why are you taking up a disabled spot? You’ve been sitting here playing games for fifteen minutes, and I want to park here.” Honestly, I was a bit surprised . So I said, “I’m allowed to park here. I was just doing something on my phone and was about to leave.”\n\nBefore I could even finish my sentence, she cuts me off: “You don’t need to justify yourself.” Yet she keeps going, telling me it’s rude of me to sit there and that I should move over because she “can’t park her car anywhere else, because its too long.”\n\nShe came iver a bit rude. I tried to stay polite, but I could feel the frustration creeping in. This kind of thing happens sometimes tho, someone sees a young guy in a car and immediately assumes he’s abusing a disabled spot. No one sees why that blue card is there in the first place.\n\nEventually, she walked away mid-sentence. And I was a bit confused. I wasn’t blocking anyone, I had a valid permit, and I was planning to leave.\n\nSo was I really being rude, or was she just frustrated?\n\nEdit: i think i stood there for 5, maybe 6 minutes. No longer. As for my disability, i have Friedreich Ataxia. I currently walk with a walking stick, am a bit wobbly when standing, everything costs energy and my voice is a little disorted. It doesn’t get any better. When i sit i look completely ‘normal’. Not for pity, just understanding.",
